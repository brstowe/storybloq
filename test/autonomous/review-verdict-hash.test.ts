/**
 * T-488 D10: the content hash classifies EXHAUSTIVELY, at compile time.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to keep true: identity is WHAT THE ROUND WAS;
 * excluded is how it was produced and what it cost.
 *
 * The real guarantee is not in these assertions. It is in
 * `satisfies Record<keyof ReviewVerdictArtifact, HashDecision>` in
 * review-verdict.ts: adding an optional property to the artifact or finding
 * type without classifying it FAILS COMPILATION, with no fixture to update and
 * nothing for an author to remember. That matters because the previous
 * exclusion-list destructure silently defaulted a new field to *included*,
 * which is exactly the case the acceptance criterion promises to catch, and a
 * hand-built "fully populated" fixture is no better -- every field here is
 * optional, so forgetting to populate one leaves a union assertion green.
 *
 * What these tests add is the runtime half: the maps actually drive the hash,
 * and every classification is honoured in both directions.
