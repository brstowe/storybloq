/**
 * T-450 step 2: the evidence fingerprint.
 *
 * The fingerprint answers exactly one question, "did the picture the human was
 * shown change?", and it is NOT the eligibility check. That split exists
 * because the first design folded the observation time and the computed ages
 * into the digest and then required an exact match against a recomputation, so
 * a legitimate confirmation self-invalidated a second later even though no
 * underlying signal had moved.
 *
 * The consequence is subtler than "exclude observedAt". Several signal fields
 * that LOOK like observations are actually verdicts about the clock:
 * `activity.kind` flips `fresh` -> `stale` with nothing but elapsed time, and
 * `lease.kind` flips `live` -> `expired` the same way. Digesting either would
 * reintroduce the defect through a different field. So the rule is: where a
 * usable stored value exists, digest the VALUE and not its fresh/stale or
 * live/expired classification. Where none exists, the reason IS digested,
 * including the clock-derived `future`, because absent, unparseable and
 * clock-skewed are three different pictures and collapsing them would let one
 * confirm against another.
 *
 * Whether the owner is still eligible NOW is the separate in-lock re-evaluation
 * and is deliberately not this function's job.
