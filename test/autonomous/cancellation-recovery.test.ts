/**
 * T-450 step 6a commit B2b part 2: the nonterminal recovery dispatcher.
 *
 * A cancel that crashed between write 1 and write 4 leaves the session NOT in
 * SESSION_END, so a re-issued cancel reaches the ordinary path. Today that path
 * would run a FRESH cancellation: re-derive the disposition from the ticket's
 * current state and attempt a SECOND stash pop. Both are wrong, and they are
 * wrong in different ways.
 *
 * THE SECOND POP is the destructive one. The first pop may already have
 * succeeded, in which case popping again applies a stash that is no longer
 * there, or worse, applies an unrelated one that has since taken its ref.
 *
 * THE RE-DERIVED DISPOSITION is the quietly dishonest one. The ticket release
 * happens BEFORE any transition write, so by re-entry the ticket is already
 * open; re-deriving would record `unchanged`, an audit record asserting that
 * nothing happened to a ticket this session in fact released.
 *
 * SO THE TRANSITION IS RESUMED, not restarted, under its original
 * `transitionId`. `outcome: null` becomes `indeterminate` WITHOUT a pop,
 * because whether the first pop ran is precisely what cannot be known: the
 * durable state is identical whether we crashed before the pop or after it and
 * before write 3, and recovery must behave identically in both.
