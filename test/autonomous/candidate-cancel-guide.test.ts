/**
 * T-450 step 8 -- the guide caller for an owner-gone candidate CANCELLATION.
 *
 * The second door onto the step-6b authority layer, and the one that ENDS a
 * session rather than adopting it. Until this exists, a session whose owner is
 * confirmed dead can only be taken over (7b) or stopped through the admin CLI,
 * which is the fail-open ISS-904 was filed about.
 *
 * What is under test, and the direction each thing fails in:
 *
 *  - THE INPUT SURFACE. A confirmation object accepted and DISCARDED is the
 *    worst outcome available: the caller has already told a human the
 *    cancellation was authorized on the picture they confirmed. Every misuse
 *    refuses at the boundary, before any mutation.
 *  - THE SESSION-ID REQUIREMENT. `handleCancel` auto-selects an active session
 *    when `sessionId` is absent, and the confirmation carries a revision and a
 *    fingerprint but NO session identity. Without this rule a human who
 *    confirmed a picture for session A could end session B, and nothing
 *    downstream could tell, because the commit's input id and the evidence
 *    directory would both come from the wrongly selected session and agree.
 *  - THE SPLIT ROUTES ON PRESENCE ALONE. Two earlier drafts added conjuncts
 *    (a live-ownership conflict, a terminal refusal) and both DROPPED the
 *    confirmed field in cases they did not anticipate. The rule they violated:
 *    do not put a gate in front of a resume-first commit, because a gate
 *    cannot see the durable records that make a retry legitimate.
 *  - THE REFUSALS SAY THE RIGHT THING. The shared refusal renderer was written
 *    for takeover and names `ownerGoneCandidateTakeover` in its retry
 *    instruction. Handed to a cancel caller unchanged, it would instruct them
 *    to ADOPT a session they had confirmed they wanted ENDED.
