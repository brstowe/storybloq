/**
 * T-495 WRITER, D3 to D5: the measurement record, the baseline adapter, and
 * the isolation boundary that makes "report-only" a property of the code.
 *
 * The record answers, for one ACCEPTED review round, what the review contract
 * WOULD have decided for each finding. It decides nothing itself. Three things
 * about that are load-bearing and each has its own tests below:
 *
 *  1. A reporter failure must be ABSENT, never an empty list. `findings: []`
 *     on a degraded record is the sentence "this round had no capped
 *     findings", which is exactly the false zero this ticket exists to remove.
 *  2. The baseline handed to the evaluator must be the stage's OWN decision.
 *     `evaluatePrinciplePolicy` refuses to invent one, so the adapter is where
 *     a wrong answer would enter and never be seen again.
 *  3. Nothing here may change a review outcome. The evaluator throws by design
 *     on a caller bug, so an unguarded call turns an integration slip into a
 *     failed live review round.
