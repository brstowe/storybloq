/**
 * ISS-1115 3.3a/3.3b: the provenance gate.
 *
 * FOUR OUTCOMES, NOT A BOOLEAN, and the distinctions are the content. "This
 * round did not label its findings" is a process failure a reviewer can fix by
 * relabelling. "This label could not be read" is a condition of one finding.
 * "This backend cannot express the label at all" is a compatibility fact about
 * lenses. Collapsing any pair sends someone to fix the wrong thing, and
 * collapsing the last one loops a lens round forever.
