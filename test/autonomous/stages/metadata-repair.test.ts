/**
 * ISS-1115 3.3a/3.3b: metadata repair, at the STAGE.
 *
 * WHY NOT IN THE PACKET TESTS, where the first draft put it. The packet builder
 * reads historical artifacts; it never sees the current report and cannot
 * control landing. A repair result computed there would pass its unit test
 * while the unlabelled report landed anyway -- the fix-the-helper-leave-the-
 * caller shape this run produced four times. So the repair is a TRANSITION and
 * is tested as one, through `stage.report`.
 *
 * THE CASE THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE LENS ONE. The report handler has four
 * backends, not the three the packet has, and `LensFindingSchema` is `.strict()`
 * with no `originClass`, so a lens round can never satisfy a mandatory label.
 * Without the exemption every lens round loops forever: a fleet stop, not a
 * degradation.
