/**
 * ISS-922: parking a session after it commits, but before FINALIZE has seen
 * the commit, must not close the stage.
 *
 * Observed live: a session committed its work item, was parked by the
 * usage-limit hook, resumed, and then every FINALIZE exit refused work that
 * demonstrably existed on disk. Recovery required hand-editing state.json.
 *
 * Cause: `git.expectedHead` served two jobs at once. Park, resume-drift and
 * checkout all advance it, which is correct for drift detection and fatal for
 * the finalization baseline, because they advance it onto the very commit
 * FINALIZE has not yet seen. `git.itemBaseHead` now carries the finalization
 * baseline alone.
 *
 * These run against REAL temporary git repositories. Asserting on field values
 * after a hand-written poisoning would prove nothing about whether the stage
 * can still be closed, which is the property that actually failed.
 *
 * P1 and P2 call the REAL park functions, so they pin the writers themselves.
 * P3 does NOT: it is a stage-level test over the state that guide.ts's resume
 * fast-forward produces, constructed directly. The real resume writer is pinned
 * separately in test/autonomous/handle-resume.test.ts. P3 therefore cannot
 * catch a composition regression across park, resume and FINALIZE; it only
 * proves the stage survives that state shape.
