/**
 * ISS-1115 step 6: the effective-blocker predicate, at every decision site.
 *
 * THE FIXTURES ARE PAIRS, and that is the whole design. Each pair differs in
 * exactly one field -- `originClass` -- and is identical in severity, category,
 * description and disposition. So a test that passes because the site is
 * broken in some general way (blocking everything, blocking nothing) fails its
 * partner. Only a site that reads provenance passes both.
 *
 * BOTH HALVES ARE REQUIRED EVERYWHERE. "Reintroduced blocks" alone is passed by
 * a predicate that blocks unconditionally, which would stall every session in
 * the fleet; "clean lands" alone is passed by the code as it was before this
 * item. The pen's three clauses are the same point: block, land, and say why.
