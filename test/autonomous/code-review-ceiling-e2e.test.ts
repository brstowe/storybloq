/**
 * The round ceiling, driven through `handleAutonomousGuide` end to end (T-470).
 *
 * The stage-level suite (`code-review-ceiling.test.ts`) pins the DECISION: when
 * it fires, what it files, what it records. It cannot pin the two things that
 * only the real path exercises, and both have bitten this codebase before:
 *
 *  1. `processAdvance` calls `assertTransition` BEFORE persisting, so a park
 *     routed to a target the CODE_REVIEW row does not list throws AFTER the
 *     ticket ledger has been mutated. That is the ISS-767 shape, and a
 *     stage-level test that inspects the returned `goto` never reaches it.
 *  2. The LEDGER effects -- reason recorded on the item, claim released, status
 *     back to `open` -- happen across the park and the handover that follows,
 *     through `withProjectLock` and the real writers.
 *
 * So this seeds a session at CODE_REVIEW holding a provable claim, with the
 * ticket-keyed counter one round below the ceiling, and reports one more round.

  /**
   * The crash window that actually EXISTS on this path, asserted as it is
   * rather than as I first assumed it was.
   *
   * An empty verdict owns no findings, so between the escalation write and the
   * ledger park there is nothing to queue and nothing to drain -- which means no
   * intervening session write. The first write after the escalation record is
   * therefore the park's own, landing after the ticket's claim has been
   * released. A resume then correctly refuses to advance (T-442 claim-lost)
   * rather than parking twice or counting the payload as a round.
   *
   * That is NOT a property of this change. I verified it against the
   * pre-existing path: a reject-only round-ceiling park, which likewise carries
   * no findings to drain, crashes in the same window and its resume reports the
   * same claim-lost refusal. The shared park owns this behavior; the
   * empty-verdict trigger simply reaches it.
   *
   * What this test pins is the part that matters and is this change's own: the
   * crash leaves the escalation record DURABLE and unfinished, no attempt is
   * banked twice, no round is counted, and the refusal is explicit rather than
   * a silent no-op. The pre-park window -- escalation written, park interrupted,
   * resume finishes it -- is covered at stage level in
   * `code-review-empty-verdict.test.ts`, where it can be injected directly.
