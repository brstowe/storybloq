/**
 * ISS-1113 consumers: the two stages that treat "an open issue exists" as
 * "there is work to do".
 *
 * ISSUE_SWEEP had NO disposition awareness at all before this change -- not
 * even ISS-1154's `escalate_only` / `owner_gated` / `duplicate`. It selected
 * on `status === "open"` alone, set the issue it picked to `inprogress`, and
 * then refused to advance until that issue reached `resolved`. Handing it an
 * issue whose whole point is that nobody is going to fix it is therefore not a
 * cosmetic wrong ranking: it is a stage that cannot finish.
 *
 * COMPLETE is here because it is the other half of the same fact. It routes
 * back to PICK_TICKET whenever any open issue remains, so once the sweep
 * started skipping non-actionable issues a project whose only open issues are
 * non-actionable would bounce to PICK_TICKET with nothing to pick.
