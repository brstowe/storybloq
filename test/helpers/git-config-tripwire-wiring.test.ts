/**
 * ISS-1220: proves the tripwire is actually WIRED, not merely correct.
 *
 * The unit tests exercise `compareConfig` directly, so they stay green even if
 * `test/setup.ts` never registers its `afterAll` -- which is exactly the
 * mutant the acceptance criteria require to go red. The only honest proof is
 * to run a real child vitest whose setup file is the real `test/setup.ts`, let
 * a test inside it modify the watched config, and assert the CHILD RUN FAILS.
 *
 * The watched path is redirected to a synthetic file via
 * STORYBLOQ_ISS1220_CONFIG_PATH so nothing here goes near the real repository.
