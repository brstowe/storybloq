 * ISS-1220: strip git's repository-pointing variables from the WORKER'S OWN
 * environment, once per test file, exactly as the client-identity scrub above
 * does.
 *
 * `test/helpers/git-fixture.ts` scrubs the env it hands to each child, but it
 * only protects call sites that go through it. A survey found 75 direct
 * `execFileSync("git", ...)` calls in this suite that belong to no `git()`
 * helper (test/core/team-init, team-setup, reservation-check,
 * merge-driver-e2e's own setup, and others). Converting all of them would be a
 * large, risky diff across files this issue is not meant to touch; clearing
 * the variables at the source closes that escape route for every one of them,
 * for any spawn helper, and for any test added later.
 *
 * This covers the INHERITED-ENV route only. The upward-discovery route is
 * closed by the cwd assertion and GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES in the fixture
 * helper; those direct call sites already pass explicit temp fixture roots, so
 * discovery from them cannot climb into a real checkout.
 *
 * Cleared before each test rather than only once, so a test that sets one of
 * these deliberately cannot leak it into the next test. A test that needs one
 * sets it inside its own body, after this hook has run.
