/**
 * ISS-1115 R1: the NATIVE codex route.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS SEPARATE FROM THE STAGE TESTS. On the bridge and agent
 * routes the guide hands an INSTRUCTION to the implementing agent, which then
 * composes the backend request, so a stage test proves the agent was told and
 * not that the reviewer received anything. On this route the handoff is code we
 * own: `codex-review.ts` builds the prompt and pipes it to `codex exec`. So it
 * is tested where the code owns it, on the constructed prompt itself.
 *
 * THREE BLOCKS, ALL THREE NEEDED. This route was missed by three revisions of
 * the plan. It returns from both stages before the packet insertion point, so
 * it got no context; its output schema is `additionalProperties: false` with
 * six required keys, so a reviewer could not EMIT provenance; and
 * `normalizeFinding` rebuilt a fresh object, so provenance would not have
 * survived even if the schema had allowed it. Fixing any one alone changes
 * nothing, which is why the plan took all three or none.
