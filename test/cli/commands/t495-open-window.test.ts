/**
 * T-495 WRITER: `storybloq review-stats --open-window` and the config shape it
 * writes.
 *
 * The window is what stops the first live run from being INVALID before it
 * starts. Without one, every artifact this repository already holds precedes
 * the feature and becomes an exclusion, so the exclusion rate is over ninety
 * percent on day one and no measurement is possible. It is also IMMUTABLE by
 * construction: a population that can be re-based after the fact cannot support
 * a threshold verdict about itself.
 *
 * The reader half (`--close-window`, the verdict, the divergence observations)
 * ships in the second commit. Only opening is here.
