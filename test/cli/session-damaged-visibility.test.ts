 * gets its own coverage rather than assuming one site's pass proves the others.
 *
 * The clock is advanced with `vi.setSystemTime`, not a backdated file

 * `utimesSync` itself bumps `ctimeMs` to the real current time, defeating any
 * backdate (see `test/core/session-age.test.ts`). Advancing `Date.now()`
 * instead is the same technique used there.
 *
 * `session show` and `session repair` both resolve their selector through
 * `resolveSessionSelector`, which accepts only hex+dash selectors and only
 * ever resolves a `SESSION_ID_REGEX`-shaped directory name (session-selector.ts).
 * A legacy/non-canonical directory name is therefore never reachable through
 * either command -- `resolveSessionSelector` returns `not_found`/`invalid`
 * before `corruptRemedy` is ever called -- so the aged+NON-addressable case is
 * exercised only against `session list`, which enumerates a contained
