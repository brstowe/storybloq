/**
 * T-446: the session guard, transcribed from the pre-T-446 guard contract.
 *
 * The fixture is the single source of truth: it carries the sentence each row
 * comes from, and the same file generates the shipped fallback prose. Citations
 * are checked against `test/fixtures/skill-step-0.5-pre-t446.md` across three
 * approved regions -- Step 0.5, the client-task-identity paragraph, and the
 * do-not-guess sentence in Step 3 -- as complete sentences, not substrings.
 *
 * That citation rule covers the ownership rows, the indeterminate-state rows,
 * the actions, and the deduplication rule. It does NOT cover the population
 * invariants or the terminal-state rule, which use the constrained
 * observed-classifier basis instead: the
 * source has no sentence about a record whose own fields contradict the array
 * carrying it, and none about a terminal session turning up in one, so those
 * rules cite nothing and instead carry a one-to-one
 * mapping onto a production gate in `PRE_OWNERSHIP_GATES` plus exact domain
 * parity against it. A row with neither a citation nor that mapping does not
 * belong in either file.
