/**
 * ISS-1197 commit 3 part B: RED-first doc-anchor tests over the shipped
 * surfaces.
 *
 * Two things are pinned here.
 *
 * 1. The handover cadence ruling. One sentence, byte-identical, in the three
 *    files a driving session actually reads: SKILL.md (every session),
 *    duet-mode.md (a manager with workers) and orchestrator-mode.md (a wave).
 *    It carries five points that were previously only in the owner's ruling:
 *    the three moments a handover belongs at, that the pushed pressure line
 *    is advice rather than an instruction to write one per message, that a
 *    percentage is never a reason to stop, that one continue after a written
 *    handover is allowed, and that a worker above 90 percent is not asked for
 *    status.
 *
 * 2. The three-state enumerations. `compact-needed` shipped in commit 2 and
 *    every user-facing list of states still said there were three, and every
 *    description of the UserPromptSubmit hook line still said it fires only
 *    at `imperative`.
 *
 * Every assertion reads the real on-disk file (or the real exported
 * registry), so these fail against the pre-commit-3 text and pass after.
