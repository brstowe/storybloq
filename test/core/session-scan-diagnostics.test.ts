/**
 * Scanner diagnostics (ISS-897).
 *
 * `scanSessionSummaries` used to drop everything it could not read, parse, or
 * account for with a bare `continue`, so no consumer could tell "nothing is
 * running" from "something may be running and I could not read it".
 *
 * BOTH directions are load-bearing here. The loud rows prove concealment is now
 * reported; the SILENT rows prove the fix did not overshoot -- each one is a
 * shape that occurs on healthy projects, and diagnosing it would drive the hot
 * ownership guard to `unverifiable` for no reason. The silent tests are the ones
 * that would catch a well-meant future widening.
 *
 * Faults use wrong file types rather than chmod: a chmod-based EACCES test run
 * as root reads the file anyway and passes for the wrong reason.

   * explicit `0`, so accepting `0` was never required for legacy support. And
   * the choice was never between admitting the record and going blind.
   *
   * So:
   *  - ABSENT        the documented legacy shape. Silent, classified.
   *  - NEWER number  `state-version-skew`. Not classified at all.
   *  - anything else `schema-version-undetermined`, WHEN the record is
   *                  otherwise admitted. ADMITTED, so the operator still sees
   *                  the session -- and BLOCKING, so the guard withholds the
   *                  aggregate rather than answering over fields read under a
   *                  schema the file does not claim.
   *
   * The last row carries a condition, and it is load-bearing. A record excluded
   * by one of the field-based gates -- a terminal-looking `status`, a
   * SESSION_END -- never reaches either population, so its unsupported version
   * is reported under `unadmitted-schema-version-undetermined` instead: an
   * omission, because the record really is missing from what was reported. The
   * tests below cover both. Saying every present unsupported value is admitted
   * would describe the case this scanner most needs to get right as though it
   * could not happen.
