/**
 * T-508: the ledger sidebar Mod's projection, checked against the one the CLI
 * already ships.
 *
 * The sidebar cannot import `src/core`. The client admits a hooks module's own
 * files by relative path and "claude-code" and refuses everything else, so the
 * projection lives inside the plugin folder and this test is what keeps it
 * from drifting: it loads one fixture `.story/` twice, once through
 * `loadProject` into `buildCompactStatusData` (what `storybloq status
 * --compact` prints) and once through the plugin's own pure projection, and
 * asserts the numbers agree. Change a counting rule on either side and this
 * goes red, which is the point (mutant M-PROJECTION-DRIFT).
 *
 * The fixture is deliberately awkward: an umbrella with children (so leaf
 * counting has something to get wrong), a blocked ticket whose blocker is
 * named by displayId, a blocker that does not exist at all (conservatively
 * blocked), a deleted ticket and a deleted issue (lifecycle), and a resolved
 * issue. Every one of those is a rule the projection has to reproduce rather
 * than approximate.
