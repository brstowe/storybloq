/**
 * T-508: the ledger sidebar Mod's projection of `.story/`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS HERE AND NOT IN src/core. A Claude Code hooks module
 * "imports its own files by relative path and 'claude-code', nothing else":
 * `claude plugin validate` refuses an import from outside the plugin's folder
 * and refuses any `node:` import, and `src/core`'s status projection reaches
 * both. So the numbers are computed here, in a file the client will load, and
 * `test/plugin/sidebar-projection.test.ts` asserts they equal the ones
 * `storybloq status --compact` prints for the same fixture `.story/`. That
 * test is the whole of "do not fork the projection": there is one set of
 * rules, and two implementations that are held equal.
 *
 * Every rule below is the CLI's, reproduced deliberately:
 *   - active means `lifecycle` absent or "active"; deleted is out of every count
 *   - a ticket named as another's `parentTicket` is an umbrella and never a leaf
 *   - counts are over leaves only, so an umbrella's own status is ignored
 *   - a phase's status aggregates its leaves: all complete is complete, any
 *     complete or in progress is in progress, otherwise not started
 *   - a blocker reference resolves by id, then displayId, then a previous
 *     displayId; one that is missing or ambiguous counts as blocking, which is
 *     the conservative reading the CLI takes
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no clock, no I/O. The caller reads the files (`$.fs`) and
 * caches what `extractRecord` returns; this module only counts.

 * one column, so the four lengths add up to the tickets plus the issues and
 * the board cannot quietly lose either. It holds against the CLI too, on the
 * ticket side of the cards: blocked + open + inProgress TICKETS is
 * `storybloq status`'s openTickets, and done tickets its completeTickets.
 *
 * Issues take three of the four columns and never Blocked: the CLI gives an
 * issue open, inprogress or resolved and no blockedBy at all, so there is
 * nothing for a Blocked column to mean. inprogress goes to In progress,
 * resolved to Done, where the cap and the ordering keep nine hundred resolved
 * issues down to a row or two, and everything else to Open, which is the
 * remainder on this side of the ledger as it is on the other: a hand-edited
 * "closed" or "wontfix" is still counted in openIssues, so a column set built
 * from status equality would leave it off a board that claims to partition.
 *
 * Blocked is a column and not a mark on an Open row. The question the board
 * answers is what can be picked up now, and a blocked ticket cannot be,
 * whatever its stored status says; keeping it in Open and decorating it makes
 * the reader do the filtering. So Blocked takes every non-complete leaf whose
 * blockedBy still points at something unfinished, In progress takes what is
 * left of that status, and OPEN IS THE REMAINDER: whatever is neither
 * complete, in progress nor waiting, whether or not its status is the word
 * "open". That last part is what makes this a partition of a raw ledger.
