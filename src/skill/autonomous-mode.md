# Autonomous & Tiered Modes

This file is referenced from SKILL.md for `/story auto` / `$story auto`, review, plan, and guided commands.

## Autonomous Mode

`/story auto` in Claude Code, or `$story auto` in Codex, starts an autonomous coding session. The guide picks tickets, plans, reviews, implements, and commits -- looping until all tickets are done or the session limit is reached.

**How it works:**

1. Call `storybloq_autonomous_guide` with `{ "sessionId": null, "action": "start", "clientTaskId": "<known-current-task-id>" }` (omit `clientTaskId` only when unavailable)
2. The guide returns an instruction with ticket candidates and exact JSON for the next call
3. Follow every instruction exactly. Call the guide back after each step.
4. The guide advances through: PICK_TICKET -> PLAN -> PLAN_REVIEW -> IMPLEMENT -> CODE_REVIEW -> FINALIZE -> COMPLETE -> loop
5. Continue until the guide returns SESSION_END

**Ticket review depth:** Optional ticket metadata `reviewRisk` accepts `low`, `medium`, or `high` and sets the minimum PLAN_REVIEW depth to one, two, or three rounds. Set it with `storybloq ticket meta set T-001 reviewRisk '"high"'` or `storybloq_ticket_meta_set`. Legacy `risk` metadata remains compatible. Malformed explicit values fail closed to high, and risk metadata never skips a review stage.

**Review effort:** Optional `reviewEffort` metadata on a ticket or issue accepts `off`, `light`, `standard`, or `thorough` and sets how hard BOTH review stages work for that item. Set it with `storybloq ticket meta set T-001 reviewEffort '"light"'` or `storybloq_ticket_meta_set`. Unset, it is derived per item: risk `high` maps to `thorough`, a `chore` at risk `low` maps to `light`, everything else maps to `standard` (issues map severity `low` or `medium` to `light`, else `standard`). A session-wide default can be set with `recipeOverrides.reviewEffort` or the `reviewEffort` argument on the start call, and an item's own value beats both. Malformed explicit values fail closed to `standard`, so a typo never buys less review than you have today -- the opposite direction from `reviewRisk`, which fails closed to `high`, because both point away from accidentally reviewing less. `reviewRisk` never skips a review stage; only `reviewEffort: off` does, and every level is disclosed on the review instruction, in a `review_effort_resolved` event, on the round record, and in `storybloq session-report`. The dial never overrides an explicit `stages.PLAN_REVIEW`/`stages.CODE_REVIEW` knob.

### Review effort levels

| Level | Plan review | Code review |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `off` | skipped | skipped (a plan-mode or review-mode session still runs its own review, at `light`) |
| `light` | 1 round minimum; prefers one fast reviewer | 1 round minimum, cap 4; prefers one fast reviewer |
| `standard` | risk-derived rounds | risk-derived rounds, cap 12 |
| `thorough` | at least 2 rounds | at least 2 rounds |

"Prefers" is exact: the dial narrows WITHIN the configured backends and never adds one, so a per-stage `backends` list you set explicitly is left alone, and a lenses-only project keeps its lens fan-out because there is no other reviewer to fall back to.

`off` is the ONLY level that removes a review stage from the walk. `light` lowers the depth of both stages and never skips either one, which matters because `light` is reachable automatically through size mapping: a heuristic may make a review cheaper, but it never makes a gate disappear.

The fix-then-re-review rule holds at every level. At `off` no review runs, so no change request can exist and the rule is vacuously satisfied; at `light` the landing rule below is what keeps it true under a lower cap.

### Recording what actually ran

When you report a review round or `implementation_done`, you may name the model and tier behind it: `reviewerModel` / `reviewerTier` on a review round, `implementerModel` / `implementerTier` with `implementation_done`. Every one of these is optional and NONE of them is ever inferred. A round reported without them records `source: "unknown"`, `evidence: "none"`, which is a truthful record; a guessed model name is not, because it reads as a fact to whoever analyses the session later. `reviewerSource` and `implementerSource` are separate fields for a reason: naming a model does NOT say how that model came to be chosen, so a round that supplies a model and no source records the model with `source: "unknown"` rather than being read as a deliberate pin. Send `explicit-pin` or `session-default` only when you actually know which it was, because the pinned count is what a reader would use to ask whether pinning changes outcomes, and rounds nobody pinned inflate it.

What you pass is recorded as INTENT, not as execution. A pin you sent is stored with `evidence: "configured"`, and only a value a backend itself reported back may be sent as `reviewerEvidence: "observed"`. The distinction is the whole point of the field: a dispatcher can say what it asked for, and nothing in the record may claim that is what ran unless something observed it. The implementer pin is recorded against the item's own attempt, so a later item in the same session cannot inherit it -- the case this closes is item B's plan review, which runs BEFORE B's first implement and would otherwise be attributed to item A's model.

**Frontend design:** If the current ticket involves UI, frontend, components, layouts, or styling, read `design/design.md` in the same directory as the skill file for design principles. Load the relevant platform reference from `design/references/`. Apply the priority order (clarity > hierarchy > platform correctness > accessibility > state completeness) during both planning and implementation.

## Precedence: task-aware active-session guard

Before any guide call that could start, resume, or cancel a session, run SKILL.md Step 0.5. Ownership determines the action:

- A matching `ownerTask` is the current pipeline. Continue normally; after COMPACT, resume automatically with the full `sessionId` and current `clientTaskId`.
- An unowned legacy COMPACT session resumes with the current `clientTaskId`; the guide binds it during recovery. A non-COMPACT legacy session stays conservative: Monitor/Other only.
- A different live owner is foreign. Open/message its task, monitor read-only, or work collaboratively on a different item. If it is COMPACT and the user confirms that the owner task is gone, recover with `takeover: true`; takeover never applies outside COMPACT.
- An expired COMPACT session can be resumed here only after explicit selection; successful resume binds the current task.
- Cancellation always requires an explicit cancel request plus exact typed `cancel <T>` confirmation. `<T>` is the shortest unique session-id prefix defined by SKILL.md; guide calls use the full id.

**Critical rules for autonomous mode:**
- Do NOT use client-native plan mode -- write plans as markdown files in `.story/sessions/<id>/plan.md`.
- Do NOT ask the user for confirmation or approval during the normal pipeline. The guard asks only for foreign/recovery choices; same-owner continuation is automatic.
- Do NOT stop or summarize between tickets unless the guide reaches a context-rotation HANDOVER -- otherwise call the guide IMMEDIATELY
- Do NOT wrap autonomous execution in scheduler or automation loops such as Claude Code's `/loop` skill, `ScheduleWakeup`, `CronCreate`, Codex automations, or thread wakeups. The state machine IS the loop: PICK_TICKET -> PLAN -> ... -> COMPLETE -> PICK_TICKET. "Continue immediately" means advance on THIS turn, not schedule a future wakeup. Scheduler and automation tools persist across compactions independent of conversation state, so a scheduled chain can self-perpetuate through compact/resume and keep burning prompt cache + compute; the user has no natural interrupt point because each turn looks like "just one more small close." The only correct pacing is the guide's `report` -> next-action cadence. See ISS-588 for the observed failure mode. Carve-out: Storybloq's built-in usage-limit waker (T-424) is NOT this pattern -- it is one bounded recovery episode per detected limit reset (wake launches retry only up to a small attempt cap when a launch fails or blocks on approvals, each is verified, and the waker exits once no ACTIONABLE records remain -- inert stood-down `manual` records that await an explicit user `--requeue` do not keep it polling), not a self-perpetuating scheduler chain. The anti-scheduler rule above still stands for everything the model itself could schedule.
- Follow the guide's instructions exactly -- it specifies which tools to call, what parameters to use
- After each step completes, call `storybloq_autonomous_guide` with `action: "report"`, `clientTaskId` when known, and the results

**Recommended setup for long sessions:**

**Claude Code:** run with a model appropriate to the repo and, only in trusted repositories, `--dangerously-skip-permissions` when unattended execution is intentional. Skip-permissions avoids approval prompts consuming context, but disables safety prompts for all tool use.

**Codex:** use a trusted repo and a sandbox/approval profile that allows the intended edits and test commands. Ensure Storybloq MCP is registered with `STORYBLOQ_CLIENT=codex`, then restart Codex or start a new session after setup or MCP source changes so the live MCP process reloads. Check `/hooks` after setup: Codex requires non-managed command hooks to be reviewed and trusted before they run, so an installed `SessionStart`, `PreCompact`, or `Stop` hook is not necessarily active until trusted. `$story auto` does not require Codex subagents; keep the guide loop in the main thread unless the user explicitly chooses `$story orchestrate`.

**Storybloq preserves compaction automatically** when hooks are installed and trusted, but it cannot invoke the client's user-level compaction command. A real client compaction runs PreCompact and then SessionStart; the same session resumes and pressure resets only when SessionStart confirms `source: compact`. `compactThreshold` (`medium`, `high`, or `critical`) selects both pressure limits and the rotation trigger. If pressure reaches the trigger at a clean COMPLETE boundary without confirmed client compaction, the guide ends the bounded session through HANDOVER.

**For an explicit user-triggered compaction:** In the owning task, call the guide with `action: "pre_compact"` and `clientTaskId`, then have the user run the client's compaction command. Do not call `resume` before the post-compaction SessionStart hook runs. The marker/guard then resumes the same full `sessionId` with `clientTaskId`. No second confirmation is needed when `ownerTask` matches or when migrating an unowned legacy session. A different recorded owner requires confirmation that the old task is gone plus `takeover: true`.

**If something goes wrong:**
- Context feels large -- continue the guide. Do not cancel manually; verified client compaction preserves the session, and threshold pressure rotates through HANDOVER at the next clean boundary.
- Compaction happened -- rerun Step 0.5. If `ownerTask` matches or is absent on a legacy COMPACT session, resume automatically. If the compacted lease expired, ask for `Resume here`; if another live task owns it, open/message that task unless the user explicitly confirms it is gone and requests takeover.
- Session stuck after compact -- inspect with `storybloq_session_report`. A verified same owner may run `storybloq session clear-compact <full-sessionId>` for a stale or blocked marker, then resume that same full id with `clientTaskId`. An expired session still requires explicit recovery selection. Never clear a foreign live lease.
- Unrecoverable error -- `storybloq session stop <sessionId>` is destructive and must never be called bare. Require exact typed `cancel <T>` confirmation, resolve `<T>` to the full id, and stop only that session.

## Targeted Mode

`/story auto T-183 T-184 ISS-077 T-185` starts an autonomous session that works ONLY on the specified items, in order, then ends.

**How it works:**

1. Call `storybloq_autonomous_guide` with `{ "sessionId": null, "action": "start", "targetWork": ["T-183", "T-184", "ISS-077", "T-185"], "clientTaskId": "<known-current-task-id>" }`
2. The guide validates all IDs, filters out already-complete items, and presents only target items as candidates
3. Session works through each item via the standard pipeline (T-XXX through PLAN, ISS-XXX through ISSUE_FIX)
4. Session ends when all targets are done (or all remaining are blocked)

**Behavior details:**
- Session cap is auto-set to the number of targets
- PICK_TICKET only shows target items -- the agent cannot pick non-target work
- Array order is respected -- first unworked item is suggested
- Blocked targets are warned about at start but included (completing earlier targets may unblock them)
- Already-complete targets are filtered out at start with a warning
- Invalid IDs cause a hard error before session creation
- Compact/resume preserves targetWork -- the session continues where it left off
- If all remaining targets are blocked by items outside the list, session ends with an explanation

**Project targets:** a targetWork entry may be a project id from roadmap.projects
(e.g. `/story auto tigris` -> `"targetWork": ["tigris"]`). The guide expands it
in place to the project's remaining leaf tickets (in `order` sequence) followed
by its open issues -- only items whose phase matches the project's phase count.
Completed members are skipped like any other done target; a project with no
assigned items is a hard error. Mixed lists work: `"targetWork": ["tigris", "T-099"]`.
Pass the project id verbatim -- do NOT pre-expand it yourself.

**Use when:**
- Triaging a specific set of high-priority items
- Breaking up work into focused sprints
- Working through a dependency chain in order
- Fixing a cascade of related issues
- Driving a project (roadmap.projects grouping) to completion end-to-end

## Parking an item at the plan gate

Sometimes the plan gate keeps rejecting because the ITEM is defective, not the plan:
an acceptance criterion that contradicts a stated constraint, a cited `file:line` that
does not hold, or a scope item that cannot be sound in isolation from the others. A plan
cannot be written around a contradiction, and an approve verdict must never be faked to
escape one.

From `PLAN` or `PLAN_REVIEW`, report:

```json
{ "completedAction": "park_item", "notes": "<the contradiction, specifically>" }
```

The guide releases the claim, records your reason on the item, returns it to `open`,
and moves this session to the next item. The rest of a targeted queue is preserved.

In a duet, where a pen commissions the gates and a worker executes them, the pen is the dispatcher and the pins above are how it says what it commissioned. It passes the reviewer pin with the round it asked for and the implementer pin with the work it handed down, and both land as `configured` -- a pen naming the tier it dispatched is stating what it intended, which is exactly what a later reader needs and exactly what must not be confused with what executed. A pen that does not know what ran passes nothing, and the round records unknown rather than the pen's own model.

| | `park_item` | `skip_ticket` |
|---|---|---|
| Where | `PLAN`, `PLAN_REVIEW` | `PLAN`, `PLAN_REVIEW`, `CODE_REVIEW` |
| Session | continues to the next item | ends with a handover |
| Reason | required, written onto the item | optional, written into the handover |

Notes:
- The reason is mandatory. An unexplained park is indistinguishable from someone
  releasing the claim by hand, which is what the guard machinery is there to catch.
- After three plan-review rounds without approval the guide surfaces this option
  itself, with the "this may be a filing defect" hypothesis attached.
- Park only for a defect in the item. Ordinary review findings get addressed and
  re-reviewed as usual.
- If the claim moved to another session in the meantime, the guide writes nothing to
  the item and tells you so; file the defect as an issue instead.

## Tiered Access -- Review, Plan, Guided Modes

The autonomous guide supports four execution tiers. Same guide, same handlers, different entry/exit points.

### `/story review T-XXX`

"I wrote code for T-XXX, review it." Enters at CODE_REVIEW, loops review rounds, exits on approval.

1. Call `storybloq_autonomous_guide` with `{ "sessionId": null, "action": "start", "mode": "review", "ticketId": "T-XXX", "clientTaskId": "<known-current-task-id>" }`
2. The guide enters CODE_REVIEW -- follow its diff capture and review instructions
3. On approve: session ends automatically. On revise/reject: fix code, re-review
4. After approval, you can proceed to commit -- the guide does NOT auto-commit in review mode

**Note:** Review mode relaxes git constraints -- dirty working tree is allowed since the user has code ready for review.

### `/story plan T-XXX`

"Help me plan T-XXX." Enters at PLAN, runs PLAN_REVIEW rounds, exits on approval.

1. Call `storybloq_autonomous_guide` with `{ "sessionId": null, "action": "start", "mode": "plan", "ticketId": "T-XXX", "clientTaskId": "<known-current-task-id>" }`
2. The guide enters PLAN -- write the implementation plan as a markdown file
3. On plan review approve: session ends automatically. On revise/reject: revise plan, re-review
4. The approved plan is saved in `.story/sessions/<id>/plan.md`

### `/story plan <project-id>` -- Project-level planning

"Help me plan the tigris project." Produces ONE plan document covering the whole
project. This is a document-writing flow, NOT an autonomous session -- do not
call `storybloq_autonomous_guide` for it (plan mode's ticketId requirement is
deliberate; project planning happens outside the state machine).

1. Resolve the project: `storybloq_project_list` (or `storybloq project list`) --
   confirm the id exists and note its phase. If the arg matches no project, treat
   the command as single-ticket plan mode instead.
2. Gather the members: `storybloq_ticket_list` with `project: "<id>"` (and
   `storybloq_issue_list` with `project: "<id>"`). Read each member's description;
   read `storybloq_handover_latest` and any lessons digest for context.
3. Write `.story/plans/project-<id>.md` covering: goal of the project, member
   inventory (tickets in order + issues), sequencing and dependencies (blockedBy
   edges within the project, cross-project blockers), shared design decisions,
   risks, and a recommended `/story auto <project-id>` execution order.
4. Present a summary and offer the follow-up: `/story auto <project-id>` to
   execute the plan.

### `/story guided T-XXX` (deprecated -- alias for targeted auto)

Use `/story auto T-XXX` instead. A single-ticket targeted auto session is equivalent. The guide handler still accepts `mode: "guided"` for backward compatibility but routes to the same targeted auto path.

### All tiered modes:
- Require a `ticketId` -- no ad-hoc review without a ticket in V1
- Use the same review process as auto mode (same backends, same adaptive depth)
- Can be cancelled with `action: "cancel"` at any point

### The review contract (REVIEW.md)

A project may declare a review contract in REVIEW.md: named principles, each with a blocking class, plus an "Outside this contract" line naming what it does not cover. Contract PROJECTION and enforcement are not wired: the projection helpers exist and are covered by tests, but nothing in CODE_REVIEW or PLAN_REVIEW calls them, no projection is persisted, and no severity or verdict is changed by the contract. The file is not inert, though, and the difference matters. Lens prompts already receive REVIEW.md as raw text (head-truncated), so it already shapes what reviewers report. `storybloq validate` is the only production consumer of the PARSED contract, and it parses it to warn when review backends are configured and the file is absent or unparseable -- which is where a project learns its checklist-style REVIEW.md declares no classes at all. Wiring the evaluation and recording it is workstream G; until that lands, do not report a measured session, an observation week, or a contract projection, because none was produced. Do not write or repair a project's REVIEW.md mid-review either: report the warning and let the setup flow propose one.

### Code-review landing cap

`recipeOverrides.stages.CODE_REVIEW.maxReviewRounds` defaults to 12. The effective cap is the larger of that value and the ticket risk's required review rounds; `0` explicitly disables the cap. `reject`, plan redirects, and unresolved critical findings remain blocking at any round. At the cap, `revise` or `request_changes` with zero unresolved critical findings advances to FINALIZE and converts unresolved major/minor findings into deduplicated follow-up issues. A `landingDecision.reason` of `max_review_rounds_no_blocking` is an instruction to land the ticket, not reopen implementation. PLAN_REVIEW convergence remains separate.

At `reviewEffort: light` the cap is 4 rather than 12, and it becomes a routing point rather than a landing point: a change request AT the cap goes back to IMPLEMENT like any other, and its fix gets exactly one more review round, during which landing is permitted again. The bound is therefore 5. Without that grace round a lower cap would land unreviewed fixes as a matter of course, which is the one rule that holds at every level. Setting `maxReviewRounds` explicitly beats the dial and opts out of both the cap and the grace round.

### The hard ceiling

The cap above does not bound a review that keeps producing blocking findings, and it was never meant to: forced landing requires nothing blocking to be outstanding, so `reject` and unresolved criticals continue instead of finalizing at every round -- normally back to IMPLEMENT, or to PLAN when a finding asks for a replan. A reviewer that keeps finding the same class of problem therefore loops without limit.

Three rounds past the effective cap, the session STOPS working on that item. It files the outstanding findings as open issues in the ledger (critical stays critical, major becomes high, minor becomes medium; suggestions are exempt) and goes to HANDOVER. When the session still owns the item's claim it also records the reason on the ticket, releases the claim, and the item returns to `open`. When the claim has moved to another session, or the item is no longer readable, nothing is written to it: the session drops it unchanged, and its current ledger state is what to check.

It ends the session rather than moving to the next item because the parked item's work is still uncommitted in the working tree, and nothing re-checks the tree mid-session; ending puts it in front of the start-of-session dirty-tree guard instead of letting the next item build on top of it. An item released back to `open` can be picked again once a person has dealt with the tree.

`maxReviewRounds: 0` disables the ceiling along with the cap, deliberately: a project that turned the cap off explicitly did not ask for a bound three rounds later. Rounds are counted per ticket and survive both a plan redirect and a compaction recovery, either of which clears the review history the cap's own round number is derived from. The issue-fix path and PLAN_REVIEW have no ceiling yet (ISS-1032, ISS-1031).

### Federation inheritance (lessons + notes)

A federation **node** absorbs the orchestrator root's lessons and notes at read time. The node's lesson digest (CLI, MCP, and the autonomous context digest) merges the root's ACTIVE lessons, and `note list`/`note get` include the root's notes — all marked with a `[root] ` title prefix. Inherited items are read-only from the node: reinforce or edit them at the orchestrator. Local ids always win a collision.

Discovery is automatic when the node lives inside the orchestrator's directory tree (the orchestrator's `nodes` map must claim the node's path). For nodes outside the tree, set `federationRoot: "<path to orchestrator root>"` in the node's `.story/config.json`; set `federationRoot: false` to opt out entirely. Standalone projects are unaffected.

Curation rule of thumb: knowledge that applies to more than one node (platform behavior, shared stack patterns, process lessons) belongs at the orchestrator root; only node-specific implementation knowledge lives in the node.

### Storyknow knowledge packs (attached knowledge)

Above the federation root sits an optional third layer: **storyknow packs** — standalone knowledge-only repos holding `K-NNN` entries shared across clients/projects (e.g. a `shopify` pack). A project attaches packs via the config key `knowledge: ["<name-or-path>"]` (bare names resolve under `$STORYKNOW_HOME`, default `~/dev/storyknow`). Federation nodes also absorb the packs attached at their orchestrator root, so a federation attaches once at the root.

Attached knowledge appears in every lesson digest marked `[<pack>] ` and is read-only from the consumer. The digest layers are: local lessons → `[root]` inherited → `[<pack>]` attached. Curation ladder: node-specific → node; client-wide → federation root; stack/platform-generic → pack.

To move a proven local lesson into a pack, use `storybloq lesson promote L-NNN --to <pack>` (the pack gains a K-entry carrying the reinforcement count and an origin stamp; the local lesson is superseded with a pointer). Promotion is a deliberate curation act — during LESSON_CAPTURE keep creating lessons locally, and if a lesson is clearly stack-generic rather than project-specific, note it as a promotion candidate in the handover instead of promoting mid-session. Pack entries themselves are managed inside the pack directory with the `storybloq knowledge` command family.

## Review findings and dispositions

When you report a review round (`action: "report"` with `findings`), each finding
carries a `disposition`. The four values are not interchangeable, and one has a
side effect worth knowing before you choose it:

- `open` -- unresolved this round (the round will not converge to approve)
- `addressed` -- fixed in this round
- `contested` -- you judge the finding a false positive. This feeds the false-positive
  learning loop and files no issue. Do NOT use it to park a valid finding you simply
  will not fix now; that pollutes the learning signal.
- `deferred` -- the finding is valid but out of scope for this ticket. This AUTO-FILES
  a storybloq issue so the work is tracked. A `deferred` finding whose severity is the
  canonical lowercase `suggestion` is exempt and is not filed (severity is normalized to
  lowercase before this check, so `Suggestion`/`SUGGESTION` are treated the same). Use
  `deferred` only when you genuinely want a new issue created.

So the rule of thumb: park valid-but-out-of-scope work as `deferred` (it becomes an
issue), and reserve `contested` for genuine false positives.

## Branch Affinity

When running `/story auto` (standard mode, no targetWork), the guide checks if the
current git branch contains a ticket or issue ID (e.g. `story/T-012-rebrand`).

**Behavior:**
- If the branch implies a specific ticket, the candidate list shows it first with a
  `[Branch affinity]` marker. The guide expects you to pick that ticket.
- If you pick a DIFFERENT ticket, the guide blocks the pick and routes to HANDOVER.
  This prevents unrelated commits from contaminating a feature branch.
- If the branch contains multiple IDs (ambiguous), a warning is shown but no blocking
  occurs.

**If you pick a different ticket, the guide offers three escapes.** The first mismatch is a
retry, not the end of the session. Report exactly one of:

| Report | What the guide does |
|---|---|
| `{ "completedAction": "new_branch_from_main" }` | Resolves main, creates this item's branch from it, and proceeds with the pick. The guide runs git itself; you do not run any command. |
| `{ "completedAction": "skip_ticket" }` | Records the item as skipped for this session and returns to the pick stage. It will not be offered again. |
| `{ "completedAction": "end_session" }` | Ends the session with a handover, the pre-existing behavior. |

You may also simply pick one of the ids the branch is scoped to.

Each of these acts on the pending item only. Send no id, or the id matching it; a different
id is rejected rather than silently ignored. Re-reporting the same mismatched pick, or
failing to resolve the mismatch repeatedly, ends the session with a handover.

## branchStrategy

Set under `recipeOverrides` in `.story/config.json`.

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"current"` (default) | Work on whatever branch is checked out. Branch affinity guards against contaminating a feature branch. |
| `"per-ticket"` | Create a branch per item automatically (`story/` for tickets, `fix/` for issues). The mismatch check is skipped, since each item gets its own branch. |
| `"main"` | Switch to main before working. The mismatch check is skipped for the same reason. |
| `"none"` | Deprecated spelling of `"current"`. Still accepted so existing configs keep working; never written by the CLI. |

**What `"main"` resolves to.** The local branch named `main`, falling back to `master` when
no local `main` exists. It is main-preferred, not default-branch-aware: a repository that
keeps a vestigial `main` while `master` is its real default gets `main`. Resolution is
local-only, with no fetch and no fast-forward, so a stale local `main` is used as-is.

**Where branches are cut from.** These deliberately differ:

- `new_branch_from_main` always bases the new branch on the resolved local main. Its whole
  purpose is to get off a branch whose history you do not want.
- `per-ticket` bases branches on the session's starting commit, which is the behavior that
  shipped. Changing it to main is an open decision, not an oversight: someone who starts a
  session from a release or integration branch today gets ticket branches rooted there, and
  moving them silently would relocate their work.

**Targeted mode (`/story auto T-XXX ISS-YYY`):**
Branch affinity is skipped entirely. The targetWork list constrains picks regardless of
branch name, so no mismatch episode can arise.
