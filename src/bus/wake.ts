/**
 * T-489 Bus idle-wake tier.
 *
 * ONE SEND, AT MOST ONE WAKE ATTEMPT. No episodes, no coalescing, no retry
 * budget, no rate limit, no persisted backoff, no scheduled recovery. The v1 spec
 * (14.3) specified all of that, but every one of those rules assumed the DAEMON
 * that owned the sweep and could hold the state centrally. This tier has no
 * daemon, by ruling, and a project-wide budget without one is a shared
 * lock-protected store whose check-and-reserve is not atomic merely because the
 * reservation file is written atomically.
 *
 * THE COST, stated rather than minimised: a burst of sends produces a burst of
 * wake attempts, and a failed wake is not retried until the next send happens to
 * occur. "Wake" is not a recovery promise.
 *
 * Rulings: r-eaxtyhqcxtfaevyk, r-snc9nppxxkrv9rr7 (as amended by

 *    even telemetry, because there was no decision to record.
 *  - `skipped`: a LOCAL decision not to engage the peer. Recorded as endpoint
 *    telemetry only. It never touched the peer, so it does not belong in the
 *    shared, hash-chained, peer-visible thread.
 *  - `requested` / `failed`: we actually engaged the peer, so these earn a wake
 *    ENTRY as well as telemetry.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `skipped` action in the entry enum (it is exactly
 * `requested | poll_observed | failed`); encoding a skip as `failed` would
 * misreport a deliberate non-attempt as an error.
