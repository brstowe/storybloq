 * Pre-command housekeeping: silent operations that run on every CLI
 * invocation before the user's command dispatches. Extracted from
 * cli/index.ts so the real startup path can be exercised by tests
 * without triggering the top-level `runCli()` side effect.
 *
 * Currently:
 *   - ISS-570 G3: auto-refresh /story skill files when the CLI version
 *     differs from the skill-dir marker.
 *   - ISS-590: legacy hook sweep runs inside autoRefreshSkillIfStale
 *     when the marker advances.
 *   - ISS-570 G1: kick off a background npm-registry check so the
 *     next invocation has fresh update-available data.
 *
 * Best-effort: never blocks the user's command and never throws.

/**
 * ISS-777: pure predicate for the CLI entry point deciding when to SKIP
 * preCommandHousekeeping (an awaited skill refresh + a background npm-registry
 * fetch). These entry points run programmatically, many times, and must never
 * phone the npm registry per invocation:
 *   - merge-driver: git spawns it once per merged .story file (ISS-736).
 *   - hook-status: the Claude Code Stop hook, fires on every response.
 *   - hook-bus-tool: the PostToolUse (on-tool) Bus hook, fires on every tool call.
 *   - session compact-prepare / resume-prompt: the PreCompact + SessionStart
 *     hooks (see core/hook-migration.ts).
 * Interactive `session` subcommands (list/show/stop/...) keep housekeeping.
 *
 * `argv` is the hideBin(process.argv) slice, so argv[0] is the command name.
 * Kept dependency-free (no heavy imports) because index.ts runs it on every
 * CLI start.

/**
 * T-502: the command and subcommand are resolved with YARGS' OWN PARSER, not
 * by reading argv[0] and argv[1].
 *
 * yargs accepts options before and between positionals, so `--format=json
 * health`, `--refresh false health` and `session --format=json intel-start`
 * are all valid invocations whose positionals are not where a naive index
 * lookup expects them. Getting this wrong is not cosmetic: it silently ran a
 * skill refresh, a hook reconcile and a background registry fetch before the
 * UserPromptSubmit hook that sits on the user's critical path, and before the
 * one command whose entire job is to REPORT on that tooling rather than
 * quietly repair it.
 *
 * Hand-rolling the option semantics was the first attempt and it was wrong
 * twice over (an explicit boolean value, and options between a command and
 * its subcommand), so the parser yargs itself uses decides instead. `Parser`
 * is a public export of `yargs/helpers`, a direct dependency; the boolean
 * list is what stops a following positional from being eaten as a flag value,
 * and `format` is declared a string for the same reason in reverse.
