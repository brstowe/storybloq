/**
 * T-477: per-commit review-coverage classification (plan section 5).
 *
 * Visibility only -- nothing here blocks a commit, merge, or transition.
 * ISS-1048's advisory-first template: ship the signal, gather field data,
 * only then consider promoting any part of this to enforcement.
 *
 * PROJECT-WIDE CORRUPTION DOCTRINE (interpretation ruling, pen, gate-1+):
 * an unparseable gate-ack file with no recoverable `ticketRef` could be ANY
 * ticket's ack -- including the contest record for the very commit being
 * classified right now, and an invisible contest silently reading as a
 * confident `"matched"` (or `"absent"`) is a false clean, the worst output
 * this feature can emit. This mirrors T-476's `loadRulingsSafe`/
 * `hasUnrecoverableEntries` doctrine (`core/ruling-loader.ts`): corruption
 * with a recoverable identity taints only that identity; corruption with NO
 * recoverable identity taints every conclusion it could conceal. So: while
 * `scanForUnattributedGateAckWarnings` (gate-ack-loader.ts) reports ANY
 * warning for the current run, no ref may classify as `"matched"` or
 * `"absent"` -- every gate-ack-eligible (ticket-shaped) ref reads `"unknown"`
 * for that whole run, via the caller-supplied `runHasUnattributedCorruption`
 * flag. A warning attributable to a DIFFERENT ticket stays excluded per the
 * ratified scoping (never taints this ticket); a warning attributable to
 * THIS ticket already reads `"unknown"` on its own, independent of this flag.

 * `gateAckScan`, when supplied, is a `scanGateAcksOnce` result the caller
 * scanned ONCE for the whole run and is threading through every ref's call --
 * see `scanGateAcksOnce`'s doc comment (T-477 round-4 finding: without this,
 * each call re-scanned `.story/arrangement-acks/` from disk, which is both
 * O(refs x files) and lets different refs in the same run observe different
 * directory states). Omitted only by single-ref callers (this file's own
 * tests included), which fall back to a private one-ref scan via
 * `readGateAcksForTicket`.
 *
 * `resolveTicketRef`, when supplied, resolves a raw (possibly differently-
 * aliased) ticket ref to its canonical id -- see `ticketAcksFromScan`'s doc
 * comment (T-477 round-4 cap escalation). Built by `storybloq landings` from
 * `ProjectState.resolveTicketRef`; omitted by callers with no `ProjectState`,
 * which fall back to the fail-closed default (nothing confirms as a
 * different known ticket, so a corrupt ack's non-matching raw ref is never
 * silently excluded).
