 * ack's raw ref spelled in DISPLAY form (`ISS-100`, not the canonical
 * `i-...` this function is queried with) needs the issue-side alias set to

 * `null`/missing result as a genuinely unknown ref. Two items sharing one
 * display id is a real, documented transient ledger state (Team Mode's
 * "Duplicate display ids"), not corruption -- a corrupted ack spelled with
 * that shared alias could belong to EITHER item, and `ticketAcksFromScan`
 * needs to see that it is ambiguous specifically to scope the resulting
 * `unknown` to both candidates, rather than reporting a confident `absent`
