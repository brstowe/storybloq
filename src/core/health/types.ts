/**
 * T-502: `storybloq health` -- the on-demand tooling check.
 *
 * Five checks answer one question each about the tooling AROUND the ledger:
 * an oversized auto-compact window, a stale CLI, a Codex install with no
 * review bridge, a stale `/story` skill, and a `crossSessionInbound` setting
 * that holds pen/worker messages instead of delivering them.
 *
 * Three rules hold for every check and are the reason this module exists as
 * its own layer rather than as six ad-hoc probes:
 *
 *  1. TWO ROOTS. `ledgerRoot` is the `.story/` root (null in degraded mode)
 *     and supplies CONFIG only. `projectDir` is the INVOCATION directory and
 *     supplies SETTINGS and MCP registrations. They are never interchanged:
 *     Claude Code resolves `.claude/settings*.json` and `.mcp.json` from the
 *     directory it was launched in, which for the CLI is `process.cwd()` and
 *     for the MCP server is the captured launch directory. A repository with
 *     no `.story/` still gets its project layers read, and the inspected
 *     directory is always reported so no message can be mistaken for a claim
 *     about the active Claude project.
 *
 *  2. READS ARE THREE-VALUED. Absent and unreadable are different answers. A
 *     layer that could not be read and COULD change the verdict makes the
 *     check `skip` naming the path; it never becomes a false `advise`. This is
 *     the whole reason the checks do not reuse the ordinary null-collapsing
 *     readers.
 *
 *  3. EVERY EFFECT IS INJECTED. `HealthDeps` is the only door to the file
 *     system, the environment, the clock, the platform and subprocesses, so
 *     the check modules are pure functions of their inputs and the default
 *     adapters (`deps.ts`) are the single place tested against a real but
 *     isolated HOME.
 *
 * The command never writes anything except the shared update-check cache, and
 * never throws: a check that fails reports `error` while the other four still
 * answer.
