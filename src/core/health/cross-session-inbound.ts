/**
 * T-502 check 5: does Claude Code deliver messages from your other sessions.
 *
 * `crossSessionInbound` decides whether a session accepts, holds or refuses
 * messages from the user's other sessions. Unset, a session running without
 * permission prompts HOLDS them, which is exactly the silent pen/worker duet
 * stall this check was added for: both agents are alive, neither is wrong,
 * and no message ever arrives.
 *
 * This is a SETTINGS-FILE assessment and says so (`detail.scope =
 * "settings-files"`). It reports what the files resolve to; it cannot see a
 * `--settings` flag the session was started with, and it never edits a file.
 *
 * Two rules carry the weight:
 *
 * ALL FOUR LAYERS MUST BE DETERMINATE. Unlike the other checks, the
 * could-change-the-verdict shortcut is NOT applied here, because the
 * remediation is a list of edits: an unreadable local file could hold a
 * restriction the suggested edits would not remove, so partial evidence gets
 * no verdict and no advice at all.
 *
 * STEPS COME FROM THE SELECTED BASE OBJECT. Managed settings supply the base
 * outright, so a user value underneath one is not a restriction and must
 * produce no step -- a step naming a shadowed layer would send the user to
 * edit a file that cannot change the outcome. The kind of advice is chosen
 * from the EFFECTIVE value, so an unset base with a local refuse says refuse,
 * and the missing base is expressed as a step rather than as the headline.
