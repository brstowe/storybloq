/**
 * Owner-liveness evidence for the session guard (T-450 step 2).
 *
 * THE ONLY PLACE the guard reaches the autonomous liveness runtime. That
 * boundary is deliberate and load-bearing in two directions:
 *
 *  - `session-scan.ts` stays a plain status path. It is the `storybloq status`
 *    DTO and documents that it does not import the autonomous runtime; making
 *    it perform process lookups would put a ps/proc call behind an ordinary
 *    status read.
 *  - `classifySessionGuard` stays PURE. It receives evidence and reads nothing,
 *    so it remains testable by construction rather than by fixture.
 *
 * WHY A WRAPPER AT ALL, rather than handing the classifier `readOwnerLiveness`
 * directly: the authorization handshake needs three values together, and no
 * existing surface carries them. `ActiveSessionSummary` has no `revision`, and
 * `OwnerLivenessVerdict` has neither the revision nor the digest. Capturing
 * them apart is what made an earlier draft's handshake unimplementable, so they
 * are captured here as one coherent triple.
 *
 * KEYED BY DIRECTORY, NOT BY ID. The guard supports duplicate embedded session
 * ids across different source directories and classifies BOTH the survivor and
 * the dropped participant. Liveness is a property of a DIRECTORY: the death
 * marker, the sidecar pid file and the telemetry tree all live in one. Applying
 * one directory's evidence to another manufactures a candidate out of a live
 * session, which is the exact false positive this ticket exists to prevent. The
 * map is therefore nested `sessionId -> sourceDir`, never a concatenated key:
 * both parts are values this module does not control, and a separator inside
 * one of them would address another session's slot.
 *
 * OBSERVATION ONLY at this step. Nothing here is wired into the guard yet and
 * no new verdict field is published; step 9 does that, once the handlers that
 * serve it exist.
