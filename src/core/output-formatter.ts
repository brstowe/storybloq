    // BOTH renderings when there is a directory name, because they answer
    // different questions and neither substitutes for the other. The name is a
    // LABEL: short, readable, capped at a label width, and the thing a reader
    // scans a list by. It is also LOSSY -- `sanitizeDisplayText` maps every
    // control character, bidi mark and invisible to `?`, and `?` is itself a
    // legal filename character -- so `dir<ESC>x`, `dir<U+202E>x` and a directory
    // genuinely named `dir?x` all print as `dir?x`. On the one line in this
    // output that says a session may be CONCEALED, that is the failure the line
    // exists to report, manufactured by the line reporting it.
    //
    // So the reversible `sourcePath` comes too, as the ADDRESS. It is bounded by
    // `PATH_MAX` rather than a label width (truncating an address does not
    // shorten it, it makes it wrong) and it is injective, so the three names
    // above stay three names. Collection-level faults have `sourceDir: null` by
    // design and have only the address, which is why that branch prints it
    // alone rather than printing an empty label beside it.
    //
    // Sanitize FIRST, neutralize Markdown SECOND, in both branches -- but for
    // different reasons, and only one of them is a hazard. For the `sourcePath`
    // ADDRESS the order is load-bearing: `sanitizeDisplayPath` introduces and
    // doubles backslashes, and `escapeMarkdownDocumentStrict` doubles them as
    // its first step, so running the escaper last is what leaves those escapes
    // as literal text. Reversed, the encoder would double the backslash the
    // Markdown pass had just inserted and `\[` would become `\\[` -- an
    // escaped backslash followed by a live `[`. For the `sourceDir` LABEL the
    // same order is a convention: `sanitizeDisplayText` substitutes `?` and
    // touches no backslash, so it cannot suffer that. Keep it anyway, so one
    // order covers every prose sink and a call site is checkable at a glance.
