    // shorten it, it makes it wrong) and it is injective, so the three names

    // Sanitize FIRST, neutralize Markdown SECOND, in both branches -- but for
    // different reasons, and only one of them is a hazard. For the `sourcePath`
    // ADDRESS the order is load-bearing: `sanitizeDisplayPath` introduces and
    // doubles backslashes, and `escapeMarkdownDocumentStrict` doubles them as
    // its first step, so running the escaper last is what leaves those escapes
    // as literal text. Reversed, the encoder would double the backslash the
    // Markdown pass had just inserted and `\[` would become `\\[` -- an
    // escaped backslash followed by a live `[`. For the `sourceDir` LABEL the
    // same order is a convention: `sanitizeDisplayText` substitutes `?` and
