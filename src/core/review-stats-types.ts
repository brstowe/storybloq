/**
 * T-432: the shape of a review-stats result.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE HONESTY CONTRACT, and it is a separate file because the
 * contract has to be readable without reading the computation. Four rounds of
 * plan review removed, in order, a false lower bound on a reconstructed count,
 * a completion claim, a backlog-change claim, a reopen claim, an inverted
 * denominator invariant and a units conflation. Every one of them would have
 * shipped as a number that looked authoritative. The types below exist so the
 * next such mistake fails to compile rather than fails to be noticed.
 *
 * THREE RULES, encoded rather than documented:
 *
 *  1. Populations do not mix. `computeP1` accepts `P1Input` and nothing else,
 *     so a P1 metric CANNOT read a state array or an event even by accident. A
 *     provenance label is a claim; an input type is a guarantee.
 *  2. Records and segments are different units and share no denominator. A
 *     segment-denominated metric carries `segments` as well as `records`, and
 *     the two are never added.
 *  3. Absence is never zero. `rate` is `null` whenever the denominator is null
 *     or zero, and the renderer prints "-" for null. There is no code path that
 *     turns an empty denominator into `0`.
