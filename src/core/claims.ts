 * Whether `guard` proves the caller may REOPEN an already-complete `existing`

 * whenever the CANDIDATE's status is not "complete", which is precisely what a
 * reopen produces. It does still cover a candidate that STAYS complete while
 * carrying contradictory claim material (ISS-913), and that is what protects a
 * claim-bearing ticket's fields, so this function is not the only guard on
 * already-complete work.
 *
 * SCOPE (1.9.0): the caller invokes this for reopens ONLY, not for every edit
 * of a complete ticket. ISS-981's filing names the harm as a reopen that
 * "erases its completion date" and undoes a session's work; a title or
 * description edit erases nothing and takes nothing from anyone. Guarding
 * those too meant a routine correction on finished work failed with "cannot
 * prove ownership" against a ticket that, post-completion, carries no
 * ownership to prove.
 *
 * ISS-981's own filing names the claim-FREE case -- the common shape, since a
 * successful completion strips claim keys -- as the headline defect: "no
 * claim, no --force" lets any caller reopen a ticket a session just finished.
 * `clearClaimOnComplete`'s "legacy: nothing to authorize against" pass is
 * correct for ITS OWN direction (completing an unclaimed ticket steals nothing
 * from anyone), but reusing that polarity here would leave exactly the gap
 * ISS-981 exists to close, so a claim-free ticket is NOT authorized by default
 * on the reopen path -- `--force` (`guard.authorized`) is the only path for it.
 *
 * A claim-bearing ticket (the ISS-913 "contradictory" shape, or any other
 * reason completion never stripped it) still delegates to
 * `clearClaimOnComplete` against the UNCHANGED `existing` ticket: that asks
 * exactly "would completing this ticket right now be authorized," the same
 * proof a mutation of already-complete work should require, and reuses its
 * proven-ownership/epoch-veto matrix rather than re-deriving it.
 * `clearClaimOnComplete`'s own side effects (status/claim rewrite) are
 * discarded; only its authorization verdict is used.
