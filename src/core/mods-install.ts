/**
 * T-507 commit D: the Mods copy `storybloq setup-skill` installs for Claude
 * Code function hooks, and the version-marker refresh keeps current.
 *
 * WHAT IS COPIED. The plugin's manifest with `skills` dropped (the copy
 * carries no skill directory; /story is installed separately), the hooks
 * runtime files (every hooks/*.ts that is not a kit test, plus hooks.json),
 * and a GENERATED hooks/install.ts whose `resolveStorybloqBin()` answers the
 * absolute path of the global storybloq binary. A Mod runs under whatever
 * PATH the client has, which is not the shell's, so the bare name the
 * repository copy answers is not enough there.
 *
 * WHERE. ~/.claude/skills/storybloq/, beside the /story skill at
 * ~/.claude/skills/story/. The client loads it with
 * `claude --plugin-dir ~/.claude/skills/storybloq` under
 * CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1; the Mod stays off until its
 * userConfig option is set.
 *
 * HOW. The whole tree is staged beside the destination (a unique mkdtemp
 * directory) and swapped in with the same atomic swap the skill copy uses
 * (`copyDirRecursive`), so a failure while staging leaves the previous copy
 * untouched and no partial copy is ever loadable. The source must carry the
 * whole runtime module graph before anything is staged: a package missing
 * one imported module would otherwise replace a working copy with one the
 * client cannot load. Installs are serialized per destination by a
 * `<dest>.lock` file taken with O_EXCL and owned by a token (a second
 * install in the same process waits on it like any other), so two setups
 * or a setup and a refresh never share the swap's fixed `.tmp` and `.bak`
 * paths. The swap itself is two renames (`dest` to `.bak`, `.tmp` to
 * `dest`), so a crash between them leaves the plugin path absent until the
 * next install runs recovery; that window is the same one the /story skill
 * copy has today, and the client loads a plugin only at session start or
 * on /reload-plugins.
