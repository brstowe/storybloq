/**
 * Structured zod validation failures (ISS-897, N-097 operator 4).
 *
 * Every session read in this codebase ends in `SessionStateSchema.safeParse`,
 * and every failure path throws away `error.issues` and reports the constant
 * string "corrupt or unreadable". An operator meeting that message has no way
 * to learn WHICH field failed short of extracting the schema by hand, which is
 * a twenty-minute archaeology for what is usually a one-line fix. zod already
 * returns the field path, the expected type, and the received value; this
 * module is the carrier that stops them being discarded.
 *
 * Deliberately not merged with `summarizeSchemaError` in `ledger-integrity.ts`.
 * That one produces a display string for a finding whose consumer never needs
 * the parts, and its exact output is pinned by validate's tests; this one is
 * structured because the session surfaces (`session list --format json`,
 * `session_report`) have to carry the fields separately.
