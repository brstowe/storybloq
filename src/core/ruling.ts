/**
 * T-476: owner rulings -- verbatim, attributed decision records with
 * supersedes-links.
 *
 * A ruling is a verbatim quote of something an owner (or, per `attribution`,
 * a manager acting with delegated or owner-veto authority) decided, recorded
 * once and cited by id from wherever that decision matters -- a ticket, an
 * issue, an arrangement's gate text. Citing items never restate a ruling's
 * text; `resolveCitation`/`resolveEntityCitations` resolve it fresh, at read
 * time, off the live `supersedes` chain, which is what makes a restatement
 * going stale (the agentkit-rn T-055/N-012 incident this ticket exists to
 * prevent) structurally impossible for anything built on this module -- see
 * `test/core/ruling-t055-regression.test.ts` for the reproduction and fix.
 *
 * DOCS STATEMENT (this is the one copy; `storybloq ruling create --help`
 * and the rendered caveat's short form both point here): `attribution` is a
 * CLAIM asserted by the person or agent recording the ruling. Storybloq
 * cannot verify who actually said what -- it can only make the claim
 * checkable, by recording who wrote the record (`recordedBy`) alongside
 * what they claim it is (`attribution`). This is why `rulingAttributionCaveat`
 * renders on every ruling unconditionally: it does not replace the two-key
 * rule for irreversible actions, and a worker is always entitled to demand
 * the owner's direct word before treating a cited ruling alone as
 * authorization for one.
 */

/**
 * T-476 ANTI-LAUNDERING CONSTRAINT (load-bearing, binding pen ruling from
 * gate-1 round 1): `attribution` is a CLAIM asserted by the recorder, never
 * verified by storybloq. The caveat below renders on EVERY ruling,
 * UNCONDITIONALLY, regardless of the claimed `attribution` value -- NEVER
 * conditioned on `attribution !== "owner-direct"`.
 *
 * Storybloq cannot distinguish a true "owner-direct" claim from a false one;
 * a caveat that only appears on honest self-labels protects against exactly
 * nobody, and an attribution-conditional caveat would BUILD the exact
 * laundering path this ticket exists to prevent while documentation claimed
 * otherwise. This was gate-1 round 1's single most important finding, and
 * the pen pinned it as a binding ruling: it must survive any future
 * refactor of this module without being softened or re-conditioned.
