/**
 * After a successful `handover create`: reconcile the caller's record (a
 * boundary the tail shows is applied first, so the stamp lands on the
 * CURRENT compaction), then stamp it under the binding rule. Best-effort.
 *
 * ISS-1185: when `root` (the MCP server's own root) has no record for the
 * caller, a worktree fallback finds it -- never creates one. The candidate's
 * identity, captured at discovery, is revalidated THREE times: immediately
 * on resolution (before any read), again immediately before
 * `reconcileUnderLock` (locateTranscript/scanTail between those two points
 * can read a large file, widening the window), and again immediately before
 * `stampHandover`. A root swapped since discovery refuses the stamp rather
 * than reconciling or writing through it.
