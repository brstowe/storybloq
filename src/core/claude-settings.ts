/**
 * T-499: the ONE reader for Claude Code's `autoCompactWindow` setting.
 *
 * Claude Code merges settings from several files; for this one key the order
 * that matters is user < project < project-local, last DEFINED wins. Managed
 * (policy) settings live outside the user's reach and are not read: a value
 * set only there reports as ABSENT, and the capture records that honestly
 * rather than guessing a window.
 *
 * Every read is bounded and non-blocking (`readBoundedFile`: realpath, then
 * O_NOFOLLOW on the resolved target). A malformed file is skipped, not fatal:
 * a syntax error in `settings.local.json` must not erase a value the user
 * set at the user level.
 *
 * WHEN this is read matters more than how: Claude Code takes the value at
 * PROCESS start, so the capture path (`session intel-start`) reads it once
 * per process era and never again for that era. Nothing else should call
 * this on a hot path.
