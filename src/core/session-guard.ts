 * A directory or session NAME, rendered for a sentence a client may RENDER

 *
 * `transcriptionNotes` and the rationale strings are returned by
 * `storybloq_session_guard` inside a JSON payload that arrives at the client as
 * plain MCP text, unfenced. A client that renders that text as Markdown will
 * read whatever structure the payload put there: a directory named
 * `[click](javascript:...)` authors a link, one containing `|` forges a table
 * row, and one containing `<img ...>` reaches a raw HTML sink -- in the
 * sentence telling an operator whether another agent is running, which is the
 * worst line in this output to be able to write.
 *
 * Two steps: sanitize for display FIRST, neutralize Markdown SECOND. For a
 * LABEL the order is a convention rather than a hazard -- `sanitizeDisplayText`
 * does not introduce, remove or double backslashes (it passes existing ones
 * through and substitutes `?` for what is unsafe), so applying it after
 * Markdown escaping could not double an escape that pass had inserted -- but it
 * is the same order the address compositions REQUIRE, and one order across
 * every prose sink is what makes a call site checkable at a glance. See
 * `candidateDirectories` for the case where reversing it actually breaks
 * something.
 *
 * This helper covers the LABEL half only. There is deliberately no matching
 * `proseAddress`: the two places that render addresses (`namedDirectories` and
 * `candidateDirectories`) have to SORT between the two steps, because sorting
 * the escaped strings would order the list by `&#58;` and `\u001b` rather
 * than by anything a reader can see. They compose the same two operations inline,
 * in the same order, around that sort.
 *
 * The STRUCTURED fields (`sessions[].sourceDir`, `collisions`, `diagnostics`)
 * keep the decoded strings unmodified and go through neither of these. A consumer comparing them
 * against a directory listing needs the decoded value unmodified; only prose is
 * escaped.

 * and regressed four times (ISS-554, ISS-568, ISS-833, ISS-848) with the same
 * shape: the prose was ambiguous, a model resolved it wrongly, and the failure
 * was a write into another agent's session. Prose cannot be unit-tested.
 *
 * This module is a TRANSCRIPTION of that prose, not an improvement on it. Every
 * branch below maps to sentences of the guard contract as it stood BEFORE T-446,
 * frozen at `test/fixtures/skill-step-0.5-pre-t446.md`. Three regions of that
 * document are quotable: Step 0.5 itself, the client-task-identity paragraph it
 * depends on, and the do-not-guess sentence in Step 3. The current `SKILL.md` is
 * NOT the authority: this ticket deliberately moved those per-relationship
 * sentences out of it and into the generated fallback. The canonical mapping
 * from sentences to verdicts lives in `test/fixtures/session-guard-matrix.json`
 * -- which also generates the shipped legacy-path file, and whose every citation
 * is asserted against the frozen document as complete sentences. Where today's
 * documented behavior is unsafe or fail-open, it is preserved here and filed:
 * ISS-897 (the scanner conceals damaged sessions), ISS-898 (no multi-session
 * rule; a takeover the server WOULD reject, whose call T-446 now withholds
 * client-side because it cannot be formed without a `clientTaskId`, leaving the
 * capability advertised and the representation question open; expired-COMPACT recovery has no
 * identity-free variant, so it binds no new `ownerTask`, preserves any
 * `ownerTask` already recorded, and derives `claudeCodeSessionId` from it when
 * one is present), ISS-899 (of the two ownership cells where this guard and
 * `liveOwnershipConflict` disagreed, the live `ownerTask` plus identity-free
 * caller cell is now CLOSED, and the ownerless legacy-id cell stays looser here
 * by design).
 *
 * The classifier is pure -- no fs, no clock, no environment -- so the matrix is
 * testable without a filesystem. `evaluateSessionGuard` is the thin IO edge.

   * claim available, and it is the one made. Byte fidelity would require
   * enumerating names as buffers end to end.
   *
   * Not the only raw carrier, and the earlier wording claiming that was wrong on
   * the face of this same interface: `diagnostics` is passed through verbatim,
   * `conflictingSourceDirs` inside it is raw, and a surviving `sessions[]` row
   * keeps its raw `sourceDir`. What is unique here is provenance -- this field
   * is DERIVED from the deduplication this guard performed, so it cannot be
   * short a participant and cannot carry one that was never deduplicated, which
   * is a claim none of the others can make about themselves.
   *
   * Everything else that names a colliding directory is unfit even to OPEN by:
   *
   *  - `transcriptionNotes` are SANITIZED for display. `sanitizeDisplayText`
   *    maps every control character and bidi mark to `?`, so two distinct raw
   *    names can render identically and a rendered name can equal an unrelated
   *    literal `?` directory. Prose that reads correctly can therefore name the
   *    wrong path, or leave the real one unaddressable.
   *  - `diagnostics` entries are passed through unchanged from the scan
   *    result. At the typed seam a caller supplies that result, so
   *    `conflictingSourceDirs` can name a directory no deduplication ever
   *    touched.
   *
   * These entries are built from the deduplication event this guard performed,
   * carrying the `sourceDir` strings it acted on, unmodified. Derived
   * rather than accepted.
   *
   * "Derived" is NOT "validated", and the difference matters because a consumer
   * reaching for this field is reaching for filesystem truth it does not have.
   * `classifySessionGuard` takes a
   * `SessionScanResult` -- built in-process by a trusted caller, or read off a
   * status payload in Mode A -- so a `sourceDir` here can be `../other-project`,
   * an absolute path, or a name with no directory behind it at all. What this
   * field establishes is that TWO RECORDS IN THAT RESULT claimed one session id
   * and one was dropped from the reported population. It does not establish that either
   * string names a real, contained session directory.
   *
   * So it is authoritative about the EVENT, not about the filesystem. Before
   * touching anything a consumer must still run every check in
   * `CONTAINMENT_CHECKS` (`core/containment-checks.ts`, re-exported here). That
   * constant is the ONE statement of them and this comment deliberately does not
   * repeat it: a prose copy is a copy that drifts, and the copies are what this
   * checklist has already had to be reconciled across once.
   *
   * And those checks license INSPECTION, and inspection is where this field
   * ends. They establish that a name is a real participant in this collision.
   * WHICH participant is stale is a separate question nothing on this path
   * answers: `kept` carries no semantic preference -- it is simply the first by
   * read order, since Step 0.5 supplies no tiebreak -- and either directory may
   * hold newer or unique state. So the contract is compare the validated
   * records, report what each holds, and stop. Neither this field nor any
   * rationale derived from it authorizes a deletion or names a command that
   * performs one; that decision belongs to the operator, on evidence this guard
   * cannot supply. The comment exists so the field cannot be mistaken for a set
   * of pre-validated cleanup targets.

 * failed -- `listAllSessionsDetailed` now THROWS for an unreadable or dangling
 * sessions root and returns empty only for a proven absence, so neither outcome
 * produces a row to carry the warning.
 *
 * `entry-not-contained` is the awkward one and stays here deliberately. The

 * to resolve outside the root, and a path whose canonicalization failed. The
 * enumerator now distinguishes them -- a proven escape is dropped in silence, a
 * failed probe becomes an `unavailable` row -- so the kind is visible in one of
 * its two cases and invisible in the other. Membership has to be decided on the
 * KIND, which does not carry the difference, so it is decided conservatively:
 * telling an operator to run a command that will show them nothing is the dead
 * end this set exists to prevent, and it is the worse of the two errors.
