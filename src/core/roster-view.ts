/**
 * T-507 commit B: the roster as `storybloq status`, `storybloq roster list`
 * and `storybloq_roster_get` present it.
 *
 * `core/roster.ts` is pure over records and endpoint projections. This layer
 * owns what sits around it: the Bus read (endpoints and their liveness) when
 * the project has the Bus feature on, the status projection (running seats
 * only; terminal seats are counted but hidden, the ledger does not forget
 * them and `roster list --all` still shows them), and the federated
 * aggregation (the orchestrator's own roster plus every reachable node's,
 * each seat labelled with its node).
 *
 * Nothing here throws for a degraded source: a Bus that cannot be read, a
 * node whose config is unparseable, a node that did not resolve, each becomes
 * a diagnostic line on the view, so status never fails on the roster's
 * account (the same rule every other status side-read follows).
