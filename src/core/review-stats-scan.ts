 * Same operation, different blast radius, so they cannot share a category.
 *
 * ONLY DEPENDENT POPULATIONS ARE SUPPRESSED. A failed `state.json` read does not

 *     A grep found the string; only the data found the record it lives on.
 *
 * One writer emits this field (`code-review.ts`, on a forced landing) and
