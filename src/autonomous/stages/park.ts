/**
 * ISS-904: first-class plan-gate park.
 *
 * A plan gate that keeps rejecting because the FILING is defective rather than
 * the plan had no representation in the state machine. `skip_ticket` exists at
 * PLAN and PLAN_REVIEW, but it routes to HANDOVER and never touches
 * `skippedTargets`, so it ends the whole session instead of advancing the queue
 * past one unworkable item. The remaining escapes were an approve verdict the
 * reviewer never gave, or the admin CLI -- and once an operator released the
 * claim by hand to unstick the queue, the ISS-784 claim-loss guard and the
 * cancel gate formed a closed cycle (see `permitsCancelDespiteSoftGate`).
 *
 * A park is the pipeline performing that release ITSELF, so the release is
 * explained rather than unattributable:
 *
 *   1. release the claim through `releaseSessionClaim`, which proves ownership
 *      against the epoch before touching either ownership field (T-442)
 *   2. record the reason on the ticket as durable passthrough metadata
 *   3. add the item to `skippedTargets`, which BOTH the targeted queue
 *      (`getRemainingTargets`) and standard candidate building already consult
 *   4. clear the draft ticket and the epoch
 *
 * Step 4 is what keeps the ISS-784 guard correct rather than weakened.
 * `reconcileSessionReality` returns NOT_CHECKED when `state.ticket` is absent
 * (claim-preflight.ts:153), so a park the pipeline performed does not trip the
 * guard -- while a park performed by hand, which leaves the draft ticket in
 * place, still trips it exactly as it does today.

  // Amendment A3 (pen ack, plan-run6.md gate-1): the plan file itself is
  // byte-frozen at fae15038... and stays that way -- this enrichment is a
  // declared amendment layered on top, not an edit to the frozen text. It
  // mirrors `parkCurrentTicket`'s HANDOVER result block (lines 360-384
  // above): that reminder trio is load-bearing for a ceiling park, not
  // decoration -- without "do NOT re-pick / do NOT keep reviewing," the
  // driving agent can bounce straight back into the loop the ceiling just
  // stopped, and HANDOVER's own `enter()` has no way to know that context.
