/**
 * Does `candidate` LOOK like this item's work commit, stranded by a baseline a
 * pre-fix CLI advanced onto it? (ISS-922.)
 *
 * DIAGNOSIS ONLY. This never causes the guide to accept a commit. It decides
 * whether the refusal can name a specific likely commit and the steps to
 * confirm it, or has to stay generic. That limit is deliberate and was the
 * outcome of review: the evidence available here cannot separate a stranded
 * work commit from a pre-existing branch tip.
 *
 * Why not heal automatically. A pre-fix state records only that expectedHead
 * moved, never which writer moved it. Parking moved it (the bug). But so did
 * the pre-fix checkout writer, which promotes expectedHead alone and leaves
 * mergeBase behind -- identical in every observable respect. If a session
 * adopts an existing branch whose tip already contains this item's ledger
 * update from an earlier session, every check below passes on a commit this
 * session neither produced nor reviewed. Auto-accepting would mark the item
 * shipped on unreviewed work; refusing costs one operator step, which the
 * message spells out. A false completion is the worse failure, so this fails
 * closed by construction rather than by having enough evidence.
 *
 * LEGACY ONLY, enforced as the first condition. A session written by this CLI
 * has an itemBaseHead that means exactly one thing, so "candidate equals the
 * baseline" is already conclusive there and nothing needs diagnosing. Running
 * these checks on such a session would actively misread a pre-existing commit
 * as the item's work -- for instance the commit that FILED this item, if HEAD
 * sat on it when the item was picked, since that commit descends from initHead
 * and does modify the item's ledger file.
 *
 * The remaining conditions each refuse cases the others admit:
 *   - mergeBase on the candidate is the pre-fix foreign-drift writer's
 *     signature; that writer moved mergeBase and expectedHead together.
 *   - Ancestry membership refuses a candidate on unrelated or orphan history,
 *     which the tree check alone would accept.
 *   - Direct tree evidence refuses a merge commit, which ancestry alone would
 *     accept (ISS-923).
 *
 * The itemBaseHead and initHead guards are also what keep this off the paths
 * whose fixtures mock git thinly -- they short-circuit before any git call.
