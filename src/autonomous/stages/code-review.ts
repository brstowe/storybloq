 * as another completed round -- which would increment the counter again, write
 * another artifact and event, and retry the handover from a different round.
 *
 * Findings are filed through the SAME durable queue as deferrals
 * (`pendingDeferrals` -> `drainDeferrals`), which carries the fingerprint
 * dedup, the critical/high/medium severity map, and -- since T-470 -- a durable
 * dedupe key on issue creation, so a stop between creating an issue and
 * recording it cannot file the same finding twice.
 * What it does NOT do is go through `fileDeferredFindings`,
 * which filters on `disposition === "deferred"`: reaching that filter would
 * mean rewriting a critical's disposition to get past it, and laundering a
 * blocker into a deferral is exactly what this path must not do. The queue is
