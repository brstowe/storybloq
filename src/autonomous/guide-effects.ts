/**
 * Session-write plumbing shared by the guide and its extracted stages.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (T-450 step 6a). The cancellation finalizer is being
 * extracted from `guide.ts` into a `cancellation-transition.ts` that does not
 * exist yet: this commit is the structural half, and the extraction lands with
 * the behavior half. That finalizer depends on these three helpers, which is
 * what forces the question of where they live.
 *
 * Leaving them in `guide.ts` would make the coming feature module import the
 * guide, inverting the dependency rather than removing it. Moving them INTO the
 * cancellation module would be worse: the thirteen unrelated `guide.ts` call
 * sites of `writeSessionAndRefresh` would then depend on a cancellation feature
 * module, an ownership inversion that invites the next cycle.
 *
 * So they live here, in a module that owns nothing feature-specific and imports
 * nothing from `guide.ts`. The intended graph, once the extraction lands, is
 * acyclic by construction:
 *
 *     guide.ts -> cancellation-transition.ts -> guide-effects.ts
 *     guide.ts -----------------------------> guide-effects.ts
 *
 * Today only the second edge exists.
 *
 * These functions are RELOCATED VERBATIM. Their behavior, including the
 * best-effort catches, is pinned by the T-450 step 5 characterization suite,
 * which mocks `status-writer.js` and `telemetry-writer.js` BY PATH; this move
 * touches neither path, so those interceptions keep working unchanged.
