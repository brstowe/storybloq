 * The cut line for Run A is not size, it is recoverability. An identity field
 * chosen wrongly is UNRECOVERABLE, because every record written before the
 * correction is permanently unjoinable -- the shape the fleet audit found, with

 * whichever ones happened to get it. That is not a hypothetical: the sites do
 * not agree on shape (one counts criticals, one asks `some`, one projects a
 * list, one builds the deferred set), so a per-site edit is seven chances to
 * write the condition slightly differently.
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO BE OUTSTANDING, and the second is the point of the item:
 *
 *  1. The disposition never settled it. `addressed` and `deferred` are the only
 *     two that do; `open` and `contested` do not, and neither does a value
 *     nobody recognises. Unchanged from ISS-073.
 *  2. The PROVENANCE contradicts the disposition. A finding labelled
 *     `reintroduced` was reported fixed and came back, and one whose label
 *     could not be read made a claim that cannot be checked. Either way, a
 *     `deferred` or `addressed` stamp on it is a claim the history refuses, and
 *     the finding blocks anyway.
 *
 * The asymmetry in 2 is deliberate. A reviewer marking a re-raise `addressed`
 * is the exact failure ISS-1115 exists to catch -- the defect that keeps coming
 * back and keeps being waved through, which is invisible precisely because each
 * individual round looks settled. Letting the disposition win here would mean
 * the label is recorded, rendered into the next round's packet, and then

 * check applied handler-wide would put every lens round into a repair loop the
 * backend cannot exit, which halts the fleet rather than degrading it.
 *
 * ISS-1115 says "No change to what lenses receive". That constrains lens INPUT;
 * it does not license leaving lenses out of a change to the shared report path,
 * and reading it that way is how this was nearly shipped.
 *
 * T-487 STEP 2: THE REASON CHANGED, THE EXEMPTION DID NOT, AND THE DIFFERENCE
 * MATTERS. Until `@storybloq/lenses@0.5.0` the reason was capability:
 * `LensFindingSchema` and `MergedFindingSchema` were `.strict()` and declared
 * no `originClass`, so a lens finding COULD NOT express the label. Step 1
 * widened both (`principle`, `dispositionReason`, `origin`, `originClass`,
 * `sinceRound`, all optional). The schemas can express it now.
 *
 * The exemption stays because no lens EMITS provenance. Removing it today
 * would demand a label from a backend that has the room to carry one and
 * nothing to put in it, which is the repair loop again by another route.
 * ISS-1138 owns the emit side, together with where a member-level claim goes
 * when a merge has to choose between members.
 *
 * The stale reason was not a comment problem. It is RECORDED on the verdict
 * artifact, so it is a persisted claim a later reader relies on, and "the
 * schema cannot express it" would have gone on reading as authoritative while
 * being false. An absence that reads as a zero is this ticket's whole subject;
 * a reason that reads as current and is not is the same defect wearing prose.
 *
 * The exemption is RECORDED, never applied silently. A silent exemption and a
 * check that failed to run are indistinguishable from the outside, and this
 * run has already spent four review rounds on that class of difference.
