 * earlier revision of this design argued that 3,000 characters against a
 * 200,000 cap could not plausibly cause that. That compares the addition with
 * the LIMIT instead of with what is left: a CODE_REVIEW prompt embeds the diff,
 * so a prompt already a few hundred characters below the cap is reachable and
 * one ruling then empties it. The feature would be the cause.
 *
 * WHAT IS FITTED IS THE RENDERED BLOCK, NOT THE RULING TEXT. Budgeting text
 * alone spends nothing on the heading, the per-citation metadata, the caveat,
 * the truncation markers, or on Markdown escaping expanding the text it does
 * count: with 1,000 characters remaining, a 900-character text passes that
 * check and still overflows.
 *
 * THE ASSERT IS WHAT ACTUALLY CARRIES THE GUARANTEE. Every arithmetic decision
