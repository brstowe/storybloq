/**
 * ISS-1115 Run A: the round context packet for the codex and agent backends.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. The lens path receives project rules, convergence history, prior
 * deferrals and known false positives. The codex and agent paths receive one
 * line: "Call `review_code` MCP tool with the diff." Every round after the
 * first is therefore a COLD READ, and the fleet data shows what that costs.
 * Codex accounts for 27 of 44 zero-finding revise rounds, and the longest
 * all-codex run went twelve rounds with major counts 4,4,3,0,3,1,7,6,5,13,11,8.
 * A count that RISES late is a reviewer rediscovering territory it already
 * covered, not a codebase getting worse.
 *
 * WHERE THE ANSWERS LIVE, AND WHY NOT IN STATE. `ReviewRecord` persists counts
 * and no findings at all, and the PLAN redirect clears `reviews` and
 * `lensReviewHistory` outright. So state cannot answer "what did round 2 find
 * and what did we decide about it". The T-488 verdict artifacts can: they carry
 * the findings, they carry the backend's own run id, they sit outside the
 * arrays the redirect clears, and their generation tag keeps a pre-redirect
 * round from being read as a post-redirect one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not RECONCILE history.
 * There is no cross-round finding reference in this codebase: `Finding.id` is
 * optional, the native codex route synthesises a positional `codex-N` that is
 * not stable across rounds, and a content key over severity/category/text both
 * collides and misses. A suppression instruction keyed on a match that cannot
 * detect its own ambiguity IS the laundering vector the item's pitfall names:
 * "do not re-raise X" where X collides with unrelated Y suppresses Y. So every
 * prior acceptance is rendered as a REPORT FROM A ROUND, marked status
 * unconfirmed, and the reviewer does the reconciling. See plan section 3.3.
 *
 * THE MANDATORY PAYLOAD is the reporting rule, the completeness disclosure and
 * the capture directive. It is assembled BEFORE optional sections and it may
 * exceed the budget, in which case it still ships: a budget too small to
 * describe a review truthfully is not a reason to describe it untruthfully.
 * Its size is not knowable in advance, because the disclosure NAMES what was
 * dropped, so the fit is computed on the FULLY RENDERED payload for each trial
 * rather than against a figure taken before anything dropped.
