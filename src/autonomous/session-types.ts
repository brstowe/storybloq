/**
 * ISS-918: `codexUnavailable` and `codexUnavailableSince` are read as a PAIR
 * (review-depth.ts: `timestamp ? withinTTL(timestamp) : !!boolean`). The
 * timestamp carries the TTL; the boolean is a pre-ISS-110 shim that nothing
 * ever clears. So the boolean WITHOUT a usable timestamp is the one
 * combination that blocks codex forever.
 *
 * Forgiving null on the timestamp alone would let a CURRENT paired state
 * normalize into that legacy sticky shape. The shape itself is not new -- it
 * is exactly what a genuine pre-ISS-110 state looks like, and that one is
 * still honored. What is new is reaching it from a state this build wrote,
 * via the most natural hand-edit there is: clearing a stale timestamp to
 * un-stick codex would instead stick it permanently, and silently.
 *
 * This runs on the RAW object, BEFORE per-field normalization, which is what
 * makes the fix possible without touching ISS-098's semantics: at this point
 * an EXPLICIT null is still distinguishable from a legacy ABSENT field. Only
 * the explicit null clears the flag. A genuine pre-ISS-110 state (boolean
 * present, timestamp never written) keeps its sticky block exactly as before.
 *
 * It is applied by `parseSessionState` rather than by wrapping the schema in
 * `z.preprocess`, so that `SessionStateSchema` stays an exported ZodObject:
 * the raw cross-field repair is centralized at the persisted-state read
 * boundary instead of changing the schema's type. That boundary is the right
 * seam regardless -- the threat model is a hand-edited FILE, and every
 * production full-schema validation of persisted state goes through this
 * function. (Raw or minimal readers, such as health telemetry, read the file
 * without validating it and so do not pass through here.)
 *
 * The repair is deliberately NARROW. It fires only on an explicit null
 * timestamp, and it clears only a flag that is literally `true`. Anything
 * else -- false, null, or a malformed value -- is left for the schema to
 * handle, because rewriting those would conceal corruption that should stay
 * visible (a string `codexUnavailable` must still fail the parse and name
 * itself, not be quietly normalized to false).
