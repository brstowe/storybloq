 * a broken link as not-found is the same concealment ISS-897 closes one level
 * up for `.story/sessions` itself.
 *
 * `lstat` does not follow, so a SUCCESSFUL call proves presence -- a dangling
 * link and a plain directory alike. ENOENT may prove absence, but only after
 * the ancestor walk below establishes that the ENOENT is about this path rather

 * follows every component before the last, so a dangling `.story` makes
 * `lstat(".story/sessions/<id>")` raise ENOENT AND `lstat(".story/sessions")`
 * raise ENOENT, and a check that accepts the second as proof has proven nothing
 * at all. The walk continues through ENOENT ancestors until it reaches one that
 * exists, because only an existing ancestor can say what the missing ones mean.
 *
 * The verdict at the first existing ancestor:
 *  - a DIRECTORY -> absence proven. A SYMLINK is followed once here, and only
 *    here: a symlinked `.story/sessions` is a supported layout, so refusing to
 *    resolve it would report every genuinely absent session in such a project
 *    as unreadable. Following the FINAL component of the path is what `lstat`
 *    is avoiding; following an ANCESTOR is what every read of that path does
 *    anyway. Every component below it is genuinely not
 *    there, which is what `.story/sessions` not existing yet looks like on a
 *    project that has never run a session.
 *  - anything else -> unprovable. A dangling symlink `lstat`s successfully with
 *    `isDirectory()` false, and a file cannot contain the path below it either;
 *    in both cases the ENOENT came from an unresolvable ancestor rather than
 *    from the thing being asked about.
 *  - an error that is not ENOENT -> unprovable, for the same reason a probe
 *    that cannot look never establishes anything.

 * would change every one of them for the benefit of the one that does not.
 *
 * Two behaviours did change, because they were wrong in the shared enumerator
 * and fixing them there fixes them here: an unreadable or dangling sessions
 * root now THROWS rather than returning an empty list (returning empty reported
 * "no sessions" over a directory that may be full of them), and a `.lock`
 * directory that actually holds a valid session is no longer skipped
 * unconditionally. So unreadable
 * entries are skipped SILENTLY here -- `session show` and `session repair`
 * surface them individually when called with an explicit selector, and
 * `session list` calls `listAllSessionsDetailed` to see all four.
