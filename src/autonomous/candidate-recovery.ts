/**
 * Candidate recovery (T-450 step 6b): the durable intent protocol.
 *
 * The candidate invariant `transitionStartedRevision ===
 * confirmedSessionRevision + 1` requires that NOTHING increments the session
 * revision between authorize and write 1. So the pre-publication phases of a
 * candidate cancellation do not live in `state.json`: the durable intent is
 * its own file in the session directory, created exclusively, advanced by
 * atomic replace, and superseded archive-first, so that recovery at any
 * pre-publication boundary reconstructs deterministically without a session
 * write.
 *
 * THE PATHNAME RULE, which every writer below serves: the canonical pathname
 * is NEVER freed. There is no instant at which `cancellation-intent.json` is
 * absent once created, so a crash anywhere in any writer leaves either the
 * old intent (retry) or the new one (proceed), and absence stays unambiguous
 * permission to create. Archives are evidence, never authority: exactly one
 * transitionId is ever live, the canonical file's.
 *
 * LOCKING: every writer here REQUIRES the already-held session lock. Nothing
 * in this module acquires it, exactly as `applyCancellationTransition`
 * requires it of its callers.
 *
 * DURABILITY: fsync barriers are explicit because rename atomicity only
 * ORDERS the two states; only the directory fsync makes the ordering reach
 * the drive. Stated precisely: on macOS `fsyncSync` is fsync(2), which
 * flushes to the DRIVE, not through its write cache (F_FULLFSYNC would), so
 * these barriers order and persist writes against process and OS failure and
 * against power loss only as far as the device's own cache guarantees. Each barrier is followed by an `__intentTesting.at` point so the
 * crash-injection suite can stop the world after every filesystem operation
 * and assert the invariants above.

/**
 * EXCLUSIVE CREATE, done as build-then-claim rather than claim-then-build.
 *
 * The obvious spelling, `openSync(name, "wx")`, creates the inode BEFORE the
 * first byte is written, so a crash in that window leaves a zero-length file
 * at the name. For the canonical intent that is fatal and unrecoverable:
 * empty parses as malformed, malformed is never absence, and absence is the
 * only state that permits a create -- so one instant of crash window wedges
 * the pathname permanently, with nothing in this module able to clear it. A
 * short write does the same with a truncated file.
 *
 * `link` removes the window without giving up exclusivity. The temp file is
 * written and fsync'd IN FULL first, then `linkSync` publishes the real name
 * in a single step that fails with EEXIST when the name is already taken --
 * the same refusal `wx` gave, at the same strength, but now the name can only
 * ever appear carrying complete, durable bytes. Every crash therefore leaves
 * either absence (the retry creates) or a valid record (the retry reads
 * EEXIST and routes through classification). There is no third state.
 *
 * The temp name is UNIQUE PER ATTEMPT, and derived from the TARGET rather
 * than always from the canonical intent. Both properties are corrections
 * (ISS-954). A single deterministic name shared by every writer in the
 * directory is stealable: `link` and `rename` resolve that name a SECOND
 * time, after the bytes are already written through a descriptor, so a
 * concurrent process that replaces the name in between makes this writer
 * publish the OTHER attempt's inode under this attempt's pathname. If that
 * attempt completed, the pathname holds well-formed bytes belonging to
 * another cycle, which parse and so are never flagged; if it crashed
 * mid-write, the pathname is empty or partial, which is the zero-length wedge
 * build-then-claim exists to remove, and this time nothing can clear it.
 *
 * The lock narrows that window and does not close it. Every writer here
 * requires the held session lock, but stale-lock breakage hands the lock to a
 * second process BY DESIGN, and a zombie writer that has lost the lock still
 * holds an open descriptor and still completes its publish. This ticket
 * exists precisely to let a second process act on a session whose owner is
 * believed dead, so those are the central paths, not exotic ones.
 *
 * Uniqueness makes the name unstealable; `wx` makes the claim on it
 * exclusive. The cost is litter, because a name no other attempt may reuse is
 * also a name no other attempt may blindly clean up: anti-litter and
 * anti-theft cannot both be bought with one deterministic name. Litter is
 * reclaimed by a sweep that deletes only temps whose owning pid is PROVEN
 * gone, since a cosmetic leak is cheaper than deleting a live attempt's name
 * and reopening this entire class.

 *
 * ORDER, and why each step sits where it does:
 *
 *   1. STAGE the heartbeat generation OUTSIDE the project lock: staging
 *      blocks on readiness acknowledgement, and holding the lock across it
 *      would stall every project write for the readiness timeout.
 *   2. Under the project lock, CHECK FOR AN ALREADY-DURABLE COMMIT first:
 *      a crashed prior attempt left the postimage in state and the intent
 *      open, and re-validation would refuse that retry as caller-is-owner
 *      (the crashed attempt's write made this caller the owner). The proof
 *      of "already committed" is the B8 gate itself: strict parse plus
 *      nonce equality with the live intent. Verify, never redo: the retry
 *      closes the intent and returns; it never re-writes state, and its own
 *      staged generation is discarded.
 *   3. Otherwise RE-RUN THE FULL VALIDATION against state loaded under the
 *      lock (the same five-step handshake, same providers), then settle the
 *      intent (create it, or resume this task's own authorized intent),
 *      then `validateStagedGeneration` IMMEDIATELY before the write: the
 *      staged child can exit, or its directory be replaced, between
 *      readiness and lock acquisition, so a readiness result from before
 *      the lock is not evidence of liveness at write time.
 *   4. ONE atomic durable postimage (B5/B7): ownerTask, the generation, the
 *      refreshed mcpServerPid/mcpGuideCallAt pair, and `candidateTakeover`
 *      in the SAME write, so a crash cannot produce a completed takeover
 *      with no audit record, or a proof without its fact.
 *   5. The content-gated close (B8), against the RE-READ persisted state.
 *
 * The staged generation is OWNED by this attempt from the moment staging
 * returns: `discard` runs on EVERY exit that does not flip `committed`,
 * structurally in a `finally`.
