/**
 * ISS-1022: filesystem primitives for the presence hook.
 *
 * Everything here runs SYNCHRONOUSLY on the per-tool-call hot path, in a
 * process that a `PreToolUse` non-zero exit would turn into a blocked tool. So
 * the posture is: bound every read by type and size, never follow a symlink at
 * a path we generate, never block, and prefer dropping an update to stalling.
 *
 * Path-safety honesty (same posture as `src/bus/paths.ts`): Node has no
 * `openat`, so a directory validated as a string can be swapped for a symlink
 * before a later child operation. What is claimed here is what is enforced:
 * components verified, symlinks and non-directories refused, reads bounded,
 * dev/ino revalidated immediately before and after the rename, unlink
 * restricted to regular files inside a revalidated directory, and a failed
 * post-check reported as a FAILED write rather than as success.
