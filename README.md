## The problem

A new coding session may be missing the decisions and unfinished work from the last. Project instructions describe how to work; handovers, stories, and review records capture what happened and where to continue.

The real cost isn't wasted setup time. It's repeated mistakes, relitigated design decisions, hallucinated context, and linear instead of compounding work.

## The idea

Every project gets a `.story/` directory of JSON and markdown files. Stories, issues, roadmap phases, session handovers, and lessons learned live there as readable files you can track with Git. Stories use ticket records in the CLI and file format.

- **CLI:** `storybloq` - inspect and mutate `.story/` from the terminal.
- **MCP server:** structured tools Claude Code and Codex can call directly to read and update the project and guide supported workflows.
- **Skill:** invoke `/story` in Claude Code or `$story` in Codex to load project state at the start of a session.
- **Mac app:** native sidebar that watches `.story/` and updates live while your AI client works (separate product, free on the App Store).

## From choosing work to the next session

- **Choose the next useful story.** Recommendations account for blockers, unfinished work, and what completing a story would unblock. Recorded decisions and a ranked digest of lessons give the agent context for the choice.
- **Build against a reviewed plan.** Autonomous mode guides planning, configured independent reviews, tests, and finalization. Approved plan snapshots preserve the approach that advanced to implementation. Confirmed review findings can become durable issues.
- **See what was approved. Know what was checked.** Gate acknowledgments in duet workflows can pin acceptance to a plan or staged code state. These records help you inspect the work; they do not guarantee correct code or replace tests, CI, and release checks.
- **Continue with the record intact.** Handovers preserve decisions and next steps. Persisted session state supports guarded continuation; automatic recovery depends on the client and the interruption.

A **lesson** is a recorded pattern or mistake, with reinforcement to help useful guidance surface again. An **approval** records acceptance of particular work, within the workflow that requested it. **Coordination** records participants and assignments; the client or configured transport supplies dispatch and messages. **Recovery** uses saved state and checks before continuing, rather than assuming an interrupted action finished.

Start with one story and a handover. Add [autonomous mode](https://www.storybloq.com/tutorials/auto-mode), [coordination workflows](https://www.storybloq.com/cli), or [federation](https://www.storybloq.com/multi-repo) when the project needs them.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @storybloq/storybloq@latest
storybloq setup --client all
```

Requires Node.js 20+ and at least one AI client: Claude Code or Codex CLI 0.130.0+. Package lives on npm at [**@storybloq/storybloq**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybloq/storybloq); releases are tagged on this repo at [github.com/Storybloq/storybloq/releases](https://github.com/Storybloq/storybloq/releases).

`setup --client all` installs the Storybloq skill for Claude and Codex, registers this package as an MCP server, and configures available client hooks. It also registers the bundled [codex-claude-bridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codex-claude-bridge) review backend as the `codex-bridge` MCP server when Codex is installed; the bridge ships as an optional dependency of this package, so a copy you registered yourself is left alone and `storybloq health` launches whichever one is registered and reports whether it answers. The bridge needs a Codex CLI login to review (or `agy` for its Gemini failover); without one it registers but reviews fail. Re-running it is safe. Codex reports installed hooks with trust `unknown`; open `/hooks` in Codex to review and trust them. `setup-skill` remains as a compatibility alias for Claude-only setup.

Setup also installs the ledger dashboard for Claude Code. On version 2.1.272 or newer, a project with a `.story/` directory draws its tickets, issues, and progress in a pane beside the transcript, with no extra flags on the install command and nothing to configure. Projects without `.story/` show nothing. Turn the dashboard off with `/plugin configure storybloq`.

## Your first two sessions

1. Open your project in Claude Code or Codex. Type `/story` in Claude Code chat or `$story` in Codex chat. For a new project, the skill guides you through setup.
2. Ask: “Record a story to add an empty calendar state. Record the decision that the API owns availability.”
3. Before stopping, ask: “Write a handover.”
4. Start a new chat and invoke `/story` or `$story` again to load the recorded project context.

## See the work

The optional Mac app shows stories, progress, and handovers from your project files. [Explore the Mac app](https://www.storybloq.com/mac) or follow the [tutorials](https://www.storybloq.com/tutorials).

## Add structure as your work grows

Start with one project and one agent. Add autonomous workflows, independent review, or connected repositories when the work calls for them. Review records preserve what was checked; they do not guarantee correctness. Tests, CI, and release checks still matter.

The CLI and MCP server are source-available under PolyForm Shield. Your coding client and optional review backends have their own data handling and costs. See the [privacy policy](https://www.storybloq.com/privacy) and the license below.

## Upgrading

```bash
npm install -g @storybloq/storybloq@latest
storybloq setup --client all
```

Same two commands as a fresh install: `@latest` pulls the newest version, and re-running setup refreshes the Storybloq skill files, re-registers the MCP server, and sweeps any stale hook entries from prior installs.

You'll usually see a one-line banner on the next `storybloq` invocation whenever a newer version is on npm:

```
storybloq v1.2.0 is available (you have v1.1.6).
Update: npm install -g @storybloq/storybloq@latest
```

The CLI also silently refreshes the skill dir and migrates any legacy hook entries (for example, from the pre-rename `@anthropologies/claudestory` package) on the first run after an upgrade — no manual cleanup needed.

Alternative install via the Claude Code plugin system: see [Storybloq/plugin-archive](https://github.com/Storybloq/plugin-archive) (legacy path; `storybloq setup --client all` is the recommended install).

## Codex plugin marketplace

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Storybloq/storybloq
codex plugin add storybloq@storybloq
```

This installs the Storybloq skill only. It does not run this package's npm install, register the MCP server, or configure hooks -- those still need the CLI, which the skill's own bootstrap step installs for you the first time you invoke it: on your first `$story`, if the CLI or MCP server isn't set up yet, the skill runs `npm install -g @storybloq/storybloq@latest` followed by `storybloq setup --client codex --skip-skill` for you. `--skip-skill` skips re-copying the skill files, since the plugin already manages that copy -- passing it yourself only matters if you're driving `storybloq setup` directly instead of letting the skill's bootstrap step do it.

If you already have a standalone Codex skill copy from a prior direct `storybloq setup --client codex` (at `~/.agents/skills/story/` and/or `~/.codex/skills/story/`), installing the marketplace plugin on top of it is an untested configuration, not a verified-harmless one -- Codex's handling of two same-named skill providers isn't something this project has tested. Recommended migration: move the existing copy OUT of the skills root rather than deleting it. A backup left under `~/.agents/skills/` (for example `story.bak`) still contains a `SKILL.md` and can be discovered as a second skill, which is the duplicate this procedure exists to remove, so park it one level up instead: `mkdir -p ~/.agents/story-skill-backups && mv ~/.agents/skills/story ~/.agents/story-skill-backups/story.$(date +%s)`, and the same for `~/.codex/skills/story` into `~/.codex/story-skill-backups/` if present. Restart Codex and confirm `$story` still works via the plugin-managed copy. To roll back, move the backup to its original path. Only then, separately and at your own discretion, remove the backup.

If the CLI or MCP server is still missing after installing the plugin and invoking `$story` once, run the bootstrap command yourself: `npm install -g @storybloq/storybloq@latest && storybloq setup --client codex --skip-skill`.

## Bootstrap a project

## Daily use

Inside Claude Code or Codex:

- **`/story` in Claude Code or `$story` in Codex** - loads project status, reads the latest handover, surfaces open tickets and issues, lists blocked work, summarizes recent changes. When the client can run background agents and the actionable backlog is large, it also surfaces the orchestrate working style proactively (a recommendation, still gated by explicit opt-in).
- **`/story auto T-001 T-002 ISS-013` / `$story auto T-001 T-002 ISS-013`** - autonomous mode scoped to those items. Drives a ticket through plan -> plan review -> implement -> tests -> code review -> commit with handovers at each checkpoint.
- **`/story review T-001` / `$story review T-001`** - runs the multi-lens review (see [Storybloq/lenses](https://github.com/Storybloq/lenses)) against a ticket's diff.
- **`/story orchestrate` / `$story orchestrate`** - drives a multi-repo (or large single-repo) backlog when the client exposes exact callable workflow/subagent tools. Codex uses `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent`, its normalized `multi_agent_v1__spawn_agent` identifier, or an exact `spawn_agent` tool. The Claude Agent View-backed `storybloq dispatch` command is shipped; a product-managed Codex dispatch backend is not.
- **`/story triage` / `$story triage`** - read-only triage of the open issue backlog: verifies each finding against the pinned current HEAD, flags already-fixed and duplicate issues, groups issues that share one verified root cause, and recommends a prioritized ticket plan. Mutates no issue and no ticket.
- **`/story bus` / `$story bus`** - polls a task-bound local Bus endpoint so an implementer and an independent reviewer can exchange advisory findings without copy and paste.
- **`/story handover` / `$story handover`** - writes a session handover capturing decisions, blockers, and next steps.

Both clients support context loading, autonomous mode, MCP, and compaction/status hooks. Codex Desktop can open an autonomous session's owning task and relay an exact owner response to it; Codex CLI safely falls back to a manual task switch. Autonomous code review defaults to a 12-round landing cap (clamped upward by ticket risk): unresolved critical findings and rejects still block, while non-blocking findings become follow-up issues at the cap. Set `recipeOverrides.stages.CODE_REVIEW.maxReviewRounds` to `0` for unlimited, which disables the cap and the ceiling below it alike. Otherwise, three rounds past the cap a hard ceiling ends the session: the outstanding findings are filed as issues, the work is left uncommitted in the tree, and a handover is written. The item returns to `open` when the session still owns its claim; if the claim has moved, the item is left exactly as it is.

`recipeOverrides.compactThreshold` accepts `medium`, `high` (default), or `critical`. The value selects both the pressure limits and the rotation trigger: `medium` uses lower limits and rotates at medium pressure, while `critical` uses higher limits and waits for critical pressure. At a clean COMPLETE boundary, threshold pressure ends the bounded session through HANDOVER because Storybloq cannot invoke a client compaction command. When the client itself compacts, the PreCompact and SessionStart hooks preserve the same session; pressure resets only after SessionStart confirms `source: compact`.

Outside the AI client, the same state is one `storybloq` invocation away.

## Usage-limit auto-resume

Claude Code sessions stop at usage limits ("You've hit your usage limit"), and overnight autonomous work silently dies with them. Storybloq detects the stop through Claude Code's `StopFailure` hook, parses the reset time from the session transcript, records the stop in a global ledger (`~/.claude/storybloq/limit-ledger.json`), and resumes the session when the limit resets. On by default once hooks are installed.

- **Autonomous sessions** are parked on the same recovery lane as compaction and woken headlessly through the full state machine -- ownership rebind, git-HEAD validation, and recovery mapping all apply, so a wake after the workspace changed is validated, not blindly replayed. Sessions stopped mid-FINALIZE are never auto-resumed (commit replay is not proven safe); you get a notification with manual recovery steps instead.
- **Plain sessions** get a desktop notification at reset with the exact `claude --resume` command. Per-project opt-in (`limitResume.plainMode: "headless"`) wakes them headlessly instead.
- **Permission posture is never escalated.** A session that ran with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is only woken with that flag if the project explicitly opts in (`limitResume.inheritBypass: true`); otherwise it notifies.

The wake is driven by a transient detached waker process, not a daemon: it polls the ledger every 30 seconds, resumes what is due (attempt-capped, staggered, concurrency-bounded), and exits when nothing is pending. It survives laptop sleep but not reboot or logout -- after a reboot, the next `storybloq` invocation or hook fire in any project respawns it, so weekly-scale waits recover on your next activity. That trade is the cost of "no daemon."

Inspect and manage the queue with `storybloq limit-status` (`--cancel <key>` destroys a pending auto-resume, `--requeue <key>` retries a stood-down record). Disable globally with `{"limitResume": {"enabled": false}}` in `~/.claude/storybloq/config.json`, or per project via `limitResume` in `.story/config.json` (also `maxAttempts`, `staggerMs`, `maxConcurrent`, `notify`, and more).

Prior art: the detection-and-reparse approach is modeled on [unsnooze](https://github.com/saaranshM/unsnooze) (MIT), which pioneered transcript-based limit detection and reset-time parsing for tmux-hosted sessions. Storybloq's version drops the tmux layer in favor of the documented hook surface and resumes autonomous sessions through its own state machine instead of a keystroke.

## Storybloq Bus

Storybloq Bus connects two task-bound endpoints in one local checkout. One may implement while the other reviews, but routing follows the paired endpoints rather than role names. Runtime messages live under gitignored `.story/bus/`; confirmed findings remain canonical Storybloq issues.

Run setup from **each participating client task**, using its actual client identity. For example, inside a Codex CLI task:

```bash
storybloq bus setup --client codex --surface codex_cli --delivery poll
storybloq bus status
storybloq bus endpoint list
```

Setup initializes the local runtime and binds the current task id (normally discovered from the client environment). If discovery is unavailable, supply the validated client task id with `--task-id`; do not invent one. A second task runs setup in the same checkout to become the peer. Re-running setup is resumable. `bus init` and `bus join` remain lower-level commands; the legacy role argument to join does not select a message destination.

`--delivery poll` uses explicit polling. The default, `--delivery live`, requires supported client hooks and configures guarded delivery. Live injection also depends on the session’s available transport. `bus auto-attach on` is a separate project opt-in for later sessions. Neither configuration guarantees an inactive peer reads a message immediately.

Messages are hash-chained, idempotent, bounded, and delivered through recoverable recipient mailboxes. Critical notices participate in ship checks and require canonical issue handling. A message is peer advice; it never grants owner approval to merge, push, deploy, spend, or perform destructive actions. `bus redeliver` can move a hop-cap-parked message to a successor thread using its recorded content.

**Optional idle wake:** `bus setup --wake idle` opts a supported Codex CLI endpoint into a best-effort wake attempt after mail is committed. It requires a reachable compatible Codex app-server, an idle thread, and proven ownership. This implementation accepts app-server version `0.153.4`; other versions are refused. It cannot wake Codex Desktop or Claude endpoints. Omit `--wake` to preserve an existing policy or pass `--wake never` to disable it. There is no Bus retry daemon: a failed attempt waits for a later send, and a wake request is not proof of receipt. `bus endpoint list` reports the policy and last outcome.

Claude usage-limit recovery, described above, is a separate mechanism. It is not Bus message delivery and does not establish equivalent usage-limit recovery in Codex.

## Federation

Federation coordinates AI agent work across multiple repos. One project becomes the orchestrator. It declares which repos (nodes) are part of the system, how they depend on each other, and how they communicate at runtime. Each node keeps its own `.story/` with its own tickets, issues, and handovers. The orchestrator reads across all of them.

```bash
# Create an orchestrator
storybloq init --type orchestrator --name "my-platform"

# Register nodes
storybloq node add api --path ../api --stack typescript --role "REST backend"
storybloq node add web --path ../web --stack nextjs --depends-on api
storybloq node add sdk --path ../sdk --stack typescript
```

Three relationship types connect nodes:

- **`dependsOn`** on node config: build-order edges. The web app depends on the API.
- **`links`** on node config: runtime integration. The web app calls the API over HTTP.
- **`crossNodeBlockedBy`** on tickets: a ticket in one repo is blocked until a ticket in another repo is complete. Example: `"crossNodeBlockedBy": ["api:T-012"]`.

From the orchestrator directory:

```bash
storybloq status              # aggregated view across all nodes
storybloq recommend           # federation-aware suggestions (bottlenecks, stale nodes, blockers)
storybloq ticket list --node api   # list tickets in the api node without cd-ing
```

The recommendation engine generates federation-specific suggestions: nodes blocking downstream work, bottleneck nodes depended on by many others, nodes with no handover in two weeks. Tickets with `crossNodeBlockedBy` refs never surface in recommendations until the blocking ticket is complete.

## CLI reference

All commands accept `--format json|md` (default `md`). Pipe JSON through `jq` for scripting, read the markdown variant directly.

`--format json` is the round-trip-safe format for editing a ticket description, issue impact, or note/lesson content: piping a `get`'s md rendering into `update --stdin` carries the render fence itself into storage (ISS-1192), since md wraps that field's content in code-fence backticks one longer than any run already inside it. `update` strips a whole-value 4+ backtick outer fence with no info string and warns when it does; `get --format json` never has this problem, since the field is a plain JSON string.

## MCP server reference

Register with Claude Code or Codex (done automatically by setup):

```bash
claude mcp add storybloq -s user -- storybloq --mcp
codex mcp add storybloq --env STORYBLOQ_CLIENT=codex -- storybloq --mcp
```

The server imports the same TypeScript modules as the CLI directly, so there's no subprocess overhead. It auto-discovers the project root by walking up from the working directory to the nearest `.story/` parent.

Full-project tools are grouped below. Bus tools are registered even before Bus setup; calls return setup guidance while it is unavailable, so enabling Bus does not require an MCP restart. Run `storybloq reference` for the complete tool inventory and argument names.

### Project queries

`storybloq_status` · `storybloq_phase_list` · `storybloq_phase_current` · `storybloq_phase_tickets` · `storybloq_ticket_list` · `storybloq_ticket_get` · `storybloq_ticket_meta_get` · `storybloq_ticket_next` · `storybloq_ticket_blocked` · `storybloq_issue_list` · `storybloq_issue_get` · `storybloq_issue_meta_get` · `storybloq_note_list` · `storybloq_note_get` · `storybloq_lesson_list` · `storybloq_lesson_get` · `storybloq_lesson_digest` · `storybloq_handover_list` · `storybloq_handover_latest` · `storybloq_handover_get` · `storybloq_blocker_list` · `storybloq_validate` · `storybloq_recap` · `storybloq_recommend` · `storybloq_export`

Some queries also refresh gitignored runtime or presence metadata. `storybloq_selftest` is a diagnostic that creates, updates, and deletes temporary records.

### Write (mutate `.story/`)

`storybloq_snapshot` · `storybloq_handover_create` · `storybloq_ticket_create` · `storybloq_ticket_update` · `storybloq_ticket_meta_set` · `storybloq_ticket_meta_unset` · `storybloq_issue_create` · `storybloq_issue_update` · `storybloq_issue_meta_set` · `storybloq_issue_meta_unset` · `storybloq_note_create` · `storybloq_note_update` · `storybloq_lesson_create` · `storybloq_lesson_update` · `storybloq_lesson_reinforce` · `storybloq_phase_create`

### Autonomous mode + review + observability

`storybloq_autonomous_guide` drives the autonomous state machine (PICK_TICKET -> PLAN -> PLAN_REVIEW -> WRITE_TESTS -> IMPLEMENT -> TEST -> CODE_REVIEW -> FINALIZE -> COMPLETE).

`storybloq_review_lenses_prepare` · `storybloq_review_lenses_judge` · `storybloq_review_lenses_synthesize` orchestrate the multi-lens review loop (requires [@storybloq/lenses](https://github.com/Storybloq/lenses)).

`storybloq_session_report` · `storybloq_register_subprocess` · `storybloq_unregister_subprocess` surface session health to the Mac app.

### Storybloq Bus (runtime opt-in)

`storybloq_bus_send` · `storybloq_bus_redeliver` · `storybloq_bus_poll` · `storybloq_bus_ack` · `storybloq_bus_thread_get` · `storybloq_bus_thread_update`

Every call requires a stable endpoint id and the current validated client task id. Poll and thread outputs mark peer content as advisory authority. `storybloq_bus_poll` and `storybloq_bus_thread_get` are read-only with respect to canonical tracked project state; poll may reconcile gitignored `.story/bus/` runtime metadata. Mutating tools remain subject to the client’s MCP approval policy.

### Federation (orchestrator projects)

`storybloq_node_init` bootstraps `.story/` in a node repo from the orchestrator context.

`storybloq_node_add` · `storybloq_node_list` · `storybloq_node_update` manage the orchestrator's node registry.

## Hooks

### PreCompact (compaction preparation, set up by setup)

Runs `storybloq session compact-prepare` before context compaction so snapshots and resume breadcrumbs stay current where the client supports PreCompact hooks. Codex setup uses `storybloq session compact-prepare --client codex` with a `manual|auto` matcher so a Codex hook cannot compact a Claude-owned session; Claude Code setup leaves the matcher empty.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [{
      "matcher": "manual|auto",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "storybloq session compact-prepare" }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Skip with `storybloq setup --client all --skip-hooks`.

### SessionStart (resume prompt injection)

Injects a compact-aware resume prompt. Codex setup uses the same command with `--codex-hook-json` and matcher `startup|resume|clear|compact`; its hook JSON also carries the current task id so same-task COMPACT recovery can continue without a copy/pasted Resume token. Hook trust cannot be verified by setup, so check `/hooks` in Codex after installation.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "compact",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "storybloq session resume-prompt" }]
    }]
  }
}
```

`storybloq bus hooks enable` is a separate project opt-in. It adds endpoint metadata and pending counts to SessionStart, and permits the synchronous Stop hook to block once for each new mailbox cursor. Peer payload bytes never appear in hook output. Claude's shared hook structure is upgraded once and remains guarded by project-local policy; Codex uses `storybloq hook-status --client codex`.

### Stop (live status for the Mac app)

Runs `storybloq hook-status` at the end of every turn, refreshing the gitignored `.story/status.json` that the Mac app and iOS companion read for live session state.

The write is content-gated: when the payload is identical to what the file already says (ignoring the observation timestamp and which writer produced it), nothing is written and the file's timestamps and inode are left alone. Idle turns therefore leave the working tree completely untouched. Genuine changes -- a workflow transition, a new MCP call, a health or lease change -- still write immediately.

Projects whose test harness treats any write during a run as a failure can turn the turn-end writer off entirely:

```json
{ "statusWriter": { "stopHook": false } }
```

in `.story/config.json`. The hook then performs no status work at all: no session scan, no payload build, no gitignore self-heal, no write. Autonomous sessions keep refreshing status on their own MCP transitions, so the Mac app still shows live state while a session is running -- it just stops updating between turns of ordinary interactive work. The flag defaults to on, and any unreadable or malformed config leaves it on.

### StopFailure (usage-limit detection)

Runs `storybloq session limit-stop` when a Claude Code session stops on a rate limit, recording the stop for auto-resume (see Usage-limit auto-resume above). Setup also adds a second SessionStart matcher group (`"resume"`) carrying the same `session resume-prompt` command so a manual reopen of a limit-stopped session gets limit-aware guidance. Both entries are Claude-only, reconciled on every upgrade, and removed automatically when the global kill switch is set.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "StopFailure": [{
      "matcher": "rate_limit",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "storybloq session limit-stop" }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Library usage

```typescript
import { loadProject } from "@storybloq/storybloq";

const { state, warnings } = await loadProject("/path/to/project");
console.log(state.tickets.length);           // all tickets
console.log(state.phaseTickets("p1"));       // leaf tickets in phase p1
console.log(state.umbrellaChildren("T-014")); // children of an umbrella
```

Full type definitions ship with the package (`exports.types`).

## File format examples

**Story as a legacy ticket record** (`.story/tickets/T-001.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "T-001",
  "title": "Add search to sidebar",
  "type": "task",
  "status": "inprogress",
  "phase": "p2",
  "order": 10,
  "description": "Fuzzy match over ticket title + description.",
  "createdDate": "2026-04-12",
  "completedDate": null,
  "blockedBy": [],
  "parentTicket": null,
  "crossNodeBlockedBy": []
}
```

**Issue** (`.story/issues/ISS-001.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "ISS-001",
  "title": "Drag handle hit target too small on trackpad",
  "status": "open",
  "severity": "medium",
  "components": ["mac-app"],
  "impact": "Dragging tickets on trackpad requires multiple tries.",
  "location": ["macos/Views/KanbanCard.swift:42"],
  "sourceRefs": [{
    "path": "macos/Views/KanbanCard.swift",
    "startLine": 42,
    "revision": "5ac37f94f7023b18f72d8e3fcf43dd64f54c11d7",
    "contentHash": "f5b1b1b65dca3d9d86adf7c5d49082aa4dc09e7903ab46ce50e8cc6b4812e4cf",
    "reviewId": "review-2026-04-15"
  }],
  "dedupeKey": "review-2026-04-15:finding-3",
  "createdBy": "external-reviewer",
  "discoveredDate": "2026-04-15",
  "resolvedDate": null,
  "relatedTickets": []
}
```

Each record is its own file. Legacy records keep display-ID filenames such as `T-001.json`; newer records use canonical hash filenames such as `t-*.json` with a separate `displayId`. Both forms coexist and are updated in place. Display IDs are sequential within type, but concurrent branches can collide and need reconciliation. Use `git status --porcelain .story/` to identify files to stage. Relationships are single-canonical-owner: a ticket's `blockedBy` field points at blocker tickets, and the reverse (who-blocks-me) is derived by scanning.

Create operations are safe to run in parallel. ID assignment and the create write happen together under a project lock, so concurrent creators are serialized and each receives a distinct sequential ID. A create can never silently overwrite an existing record; under heavy simultaneous contention a creator fails loudly with an error rather than colliding.

Issue `sourceRefs` preserve review evidence independently of mutable `path:line` display strings. Storybloq hashes only the normalized referenced line range and never stores source excerpts. A supplied revision is resolved to a Git commit; otherwise Storybloq captures the working-tree range and records HEAD only when those bytes match. `storybloq validate` reports an error when original evidence cannot be resolved, a warning when valid historical evidence moved or changed at HEAD, and no finding when it still matches.

Use `storybloq validate --integrity-only` when damaged `config.json` or `roadmap.json` prevents normal loading. This read-only preflight scans every `.story/**/*.json` file in one pass, reports parser positions where available, and separates critical singleton failures from skippable item and auxiliary-file failures. It never rewrites damaged files.

Confirmed manual or external review findings should be filed directly as open issues. Search first, pass reviewer attribution in `createdBy`, attach the review ID and revision through `sourceRefs`, and use a stable `dedupeKey` such as `<review-id>:<finding-id>` so retries are idempotent. Keep uncertain design questions as notes or owner questions; the implementing agent owns issue status and resolution.

Ticket and issue records preserve unknown JSON fields. Use `storybloq ticket meta` and `storybloq issue meta` to read or mutate those custom passthrough fields without touching core Storybloq fields. Values are JSON, and dot paths address nested objects, for example `storybloq ticket meta set T-001 integration.linear '"ABC-123"'`.

Autonomous plan-review depth can be seeded per ticket with `reviewRisk` metadata (`low`, `medium`, or `high`). For example, `storybloq ticket meta set T-001 reviewRisk '"high"'` requires at least three plan-review rounds. Legacy `risk` metadata is also recognized, but `reviewRisk` is the canonical key. This setting changes review depth only; it never skips a review stage.

## Example workflow

```bash
# Initialize
storybloq init --name "my-app"

# Add the first phase
storybloq phase create --id bootstrap --name "Bootstrap" --label "PHASE 1" \
  --description "Get the app running end-to-end"

# Add a story (the CLI command is ticket)
storybloq ticket create --title "Scaffold Next.js" --type task --phase bootstrap

# Start Claude Code and type /story, or invoke $story in Codex, then work on it
# (or go autonomous: /story auto T-001 / $story auto T-001)

# Inspect before committing: autonomous FINALIZE may already have committed
git status --porcelain
git log -1 --oneline

# Stage the specific changed source and .story/ files reported by Git, then commit
# Ask the agent to write a handover before ending a collaborative session

# In the next session, invoke /story or $story to load the recorded context.
```

## Team mode

`.story/` is plain JSON tracked by git, so a team sharing it hits the same two problems any shared state hits: concurrent edits to the same record, and concurrent creation of new records. Team mode addresses both.

```bash
storybloq team init     # once per project; commit the result
storybloq team setup    # once per clone, by every teammate
```

`team init` configures the project for team work (schema version, claim staleness, id allocator, required client features) and runs setup for your own clone. `team setup` installs the `storybloq-json` git merge driver into the clone's local git config and writes `.story/.gitattributes` so `.story/` JSON files route through it. Git config is per-clone, so each teammate runs setup once in each checkout. `storybloq team doctor` checks the whole arrangement (duplicate display ids, unresolved conflicts, stale claims, merge driver installed) and exits non-zero on errors with `--ci`; see [Team CI](#team-ci) below for the merge-gate workflow.

### Concurrent edits: the merge model

When git merges two branches that both touched the same `.story/` record, the merge driver runs a structured three-way merge per record instead of a line-based text merge. Fields merge independently: if one teammate changes a ticket's `status` while another edits its `description`, both changes land. When the same field diverges on both sides, the driver picks neither. It records the divergence as a structured `_conflicts` block inside the record, so the file stays valid JSON with no conflict markers; git still reports the path as conflicted, so `git add` the file and commit to conclude the merge, then resolve the recorded conflicts at your own pace (they carry forward across later merges until resolved). A project with unresolved `_conflicts` is write-blocked until every conflict is resolved:

```bash
storybloq conflicts list                     # every item with unresolved conflicts
storybloq conflicts show T-042               # field-level detail: base, ours, theirs
storybloq resolve T-042 --field status --use theirs
storybloq resolve T-042 --field title --value '"Merged title"'
storybloq resolve config                     # config.json merges the same way
storybloq resolve roadmap                    # so does roadmap.json
```

### Concurrent creates: display id collisions

Two teammates creating items on parallel branches is a different failure mode. New records are stored under a random canonical-id filename (for example `t-8f2kq0v3n1xw9d4e.json`), so independently created items never collide at the file level; only legacy sequential filenames (`ISS-041.json`, from projects that predate canonical ids) can still path-collide. What can collide is the human-facing display id: both branches compute "next free number" locally and both mint `T-042`. That is not a merge conflict, it is a duplicate, and it has its own tool:

```bash
storybloq reconcile          # renumber duplicates; the copy already on the protected ref, else the earlier one, keeps the number
storybloq reconcile --ci     # detect only: exit non-zero if duplicates exist, mutate nothing
```

Renumbered items keep their old display id in `previousDisplayIds`, so existing references to the old number still resolve.

### Choosing an id allocator

`team init --id-allocator local|git-refs` picks how display ids are allocated. The tradeoff:

| | `local` (default) | `git-refs` |
|---|---|---|
| Allocation | next free number, computed from the local checkout | ids reserved as refs on the shared git remote before use |
| Collisions | divergent branches can mint duplicate display ids | prevented at the source |
| Recovery | `storybloq reconcile` after merges; gate merges with `reconcile --ci` | not needed for ids |
| Requirements | none; works offline | a reachable shared remote with ref-push permission |
| Older clients | any client can create items | clients that do not declare the reservation capability fail closed (see caveat below) |

With `git-refs`, `team init` also adds `remote-ref-reservations` to `team.requiredFeatures`, so clients that do not declare that capability refuse to create items instead of allocating locally against a git-refs team and colliding. One caveat: current Mac app releases predate reservations while still declaring the capability, so until the Mac-side update ships, avoid creating items from the Mac app on git-refs teams. `storybloq team reserve tickets --count 5` reserves a batch of ids up front.

`local` is unsafe specifically when seats create items on their own branches or worktrees (agent orchestration, per-feature branches) rather than one shared working copy (ISS-1190); `create` warns once per branch per 24h when it detects that shape on the local allocator, and `reconcile`/`team doctor` name the same `git-refs` fix when they find or flag a collision.

### Schema version and older clients

`team init` stamps `schemaVersion: 3` in `.story/config.json`. CLI releases before 1.5.0 refuse a schemaVersion-3 project cleanly, for both reads and writes, with an upgrade message (`Config schemaVersion 3 exceeds max supported 2. Run: npm update -g @storybloq/storybloq`). The hard failure is deliberate: those clients do not understand team-mode data, and in mixed-version teams they previously produced silent partial reads instead of an error.

Team repos created before the fence carry `schemaVersion: 2`. To upgrade an existing team repo: wait until every teammate runs a 1.5.0+ CLI, then set `schemaVersion` to 3 manually (or re-run `storybloq team init`, which performs the same upgrade). Older Mac app builds show a schemaVersion-3 project as read-only until updated; no data is lost.

### Upgrading a repo that predates `.story/.gitignore`

`team init` and `team setup` write `.story/.gitignore` covering the machine-local files (`sessions/`, `snapshots/`, `status.json`, `federation-cache.json`, `channel-inbox/`). A gitignore does not untrack files that are already tracked, so a project that adopted storybloq before the gitignore existed may already have ephemeral files in git history. Check once and untrack them:

```bash
git ls-files .story/ | grep -E 'sessions/|snapshots/|status\.json|federation-cache\.json|channel-inbox/'
git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch .story/sessions .story/snapshots .story/status.json .story/federation-cache.json .story/channel-inbox
```

Commit the removal. Session state records absolute paths (including your username), so this is worth doing before the first shared push.

### Deletes leave tombstones

Deleting a ticket, issue, note, or lesson in team mode does not remove it from the shared repo. The file stays, keeping its full original content, plus a lifecycle marker: `lifecycle: "deleted"`, a `deletedAt` timestamp, and `deletedBy` set to the deleter's git `user.email`. Resolving a delete-versus-edit conflict can likewise stamp the resolver's email as `deletedBy` on a synthesized tombstone. Tombstones stay in the repo until someone runs `storybloq gc --apply` (default 30-day retention).

The takeaway: deleting an item hides it from normal views, but it does not remove the content or your identity stamp from teammates' clones. Run `storybloq gc` to preview eligible tombstones, then `storybloq gc --apply` to purge them once they pass retention.

### What your team sees

Team mode shares state through the repo, so everything committed under `.story/` is visible to everyone with repo access:

- Tickets, issues, notes, and lessons, including all free-text fields.
- Handovers: narrative session documents, often the most detailed record of what happened and why.
- Claim blocks on in-progress items: the claiming teammate's git identity (`user.email`), branch name, and claim timestamp, plus a `claimedBySession` UUID while an autonomous session works the item.
- Unresolved merge conflicts: after a divergent merge, the affected record carries the conflicting values from both sides (base, ours, and theirs) inside its `_conflicts` block until someone resolves it. Text a teammate wrote but later lost in arbitration stays visible in the file until resolution.

The machine-local files stay out of the repo once the gitignore is in place: `sessions/` (autonomous session state, including each session's `events.log`), `snapshots/`, `status.json`, `federation-cache.json`, and `channel-inbox/`. Treat committed `.story/` content with the same care as commit messages and code comments; it travels with the repo.

## Team CI

For team-mode projects, add CI validation to catch duplicate displayIds and stale references before merge. See [TEAM_CI.md](TEAM_CI.md) for a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow.
